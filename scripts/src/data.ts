Oral antibiotic for MSSA:\n   - Cephalexin 500mg QID x 7-10 days, OR\n   - Dicloxacillin 500mg QID x 7-10 days\n2. If penicillin allergic: TMP-SMX DS BID or Clindamycin\n3. Mark cellulitis border to monitor progression/improvement\n4. Reassess in 2-3 days\n\nWound Care:\n5. Wound cleansing: Saline or clean water, gentle irrigation\n6. Debridement: Sharp debridement of fibrinous tissue (by wound specialist)\n7. Moist wound healing:\n   - Foam dressing (absorbent for exudate)\n   - Hydrocolloid if minimal exudate\n   - Change dressing every 1-3 days depending on exudate\n8. Avoid cytotoxic agents (hydrogen peroxide, iodine directly in wound)\n\nCompression Therapy (Essential for Venous Ulcers):\n9. After infection controlled and arterial disease ruled out (ABI >0.8):\n   - Compression bandaging or stockings\n   - Target: 30-40 mmHg compression\n10. Multi-layer compression bandages:\n    - Profore system or Unna boot\n    - Changed weekly\n11. Once healed: Compression stockings 30-40 mmHg daily (lifelong)\n12. Compression contraindicated if ABI <0.5 (arterial disease)\n\nEdema Management:\n13. Leg elevation: Above heart level when sitting/lying\n14. Avoid prolonged standing or sitting\n15. Frequent walking/ankle exercises\n16. Consider diuretics only if CHF component\n\nVenous Insufficiency Treatment:\n17. Vascular surgery referral for definitive treatment:\n    - Endovenous ablation (laser or radiofrequency)\n    - Sclerotherapy\n    - Saphenous vein stripping (less common now)\n18. Treating reflux reduces recurrence of ulcers\n19. Perforator treatment if significant incompetence\n\nOptimize Healing Factors:\n20. Diabetes control: Target HbA1c <7%\n21. Nutrition: Adequate protein, vitamin C, zinc\n22. Albumin is low-normal - optimize nutrition\n23. Weight loss counseling (reduces venous pressure)\n24. Smoking: Confirm continued abstinence\n\nAdvanced Therapies (If Not Healing):\n25. If no improvement in 4-6 weeks:\n    - Skin substitutes (Apligraf, Dermagraft)\n    - Negative pressure wound therapy (VAC)\n    - Skin grafting\n26. Consider biopsy if ulcer >3 months without healing (rule out malignancy - Marjolin ulcer)\n\nPain Management:\n27. Leg elevation often helps pain\n28. Topical lidocaine before dressing changes if painful\n29. Acetaminophen PRN\n30. Avoid NSAIDs if possible (can delay healing)\n\nInfection Prevention:\n31. Keep wound clean\n32. Watch for signs of worsening infection:\n    - Increased pain, spreading erythema, fever\n    - Purulent drainage, foul odor\n33. Return immediately if systemic symptoms\n\nMonitoring:\n34. Weekly wound measurements (length, width, depth)\n35. Photo documentation\n36. Track healing trajectory (expect ~10-15% reduction per week)\n37. If stalled: Reassess, consider advanced therapies\n\nRecurrence Prevention:\n38. Compression stockings for life after healing (30-40 mmHg)\n39. Leg elevation\n40. Treat underlying venous insufficiency\n41. Weight loss\n42. Regular walking\n43. Skin moisturization (prevent skin breakdown)\n\nFollow-up:\n45. Wound care clinic weekly\n46. Vascular surgery consult for venous ablation\n47. Reassess antibiotic response in 3-5 days\n48. Dietitian for weight loss support"

Topical immunotherapy (for extensive disease):\n   - DPCP (Diphenylcyclopropenone) or SADBE\n   - Induces contact allergy to stimulate immune response\n   - Requires specialized application\n7. JAK inhibitors (for severe/refractory):\n   - Baricitinib (FDA approved for severe AA)\n   - Ritlecitinib (FDA approved for AA)\n   - Consider if >50% hair loss or refractory to other treatments\n\nNot Recommended:\n8. Systemic corticosteroids: Only for acute, rapidly progressive cases (short-term)\n   - High relapse rate, side effects with long-term use\n9. Oral minoxidil: Not standard but sometimes used\n\nPrognosis Discussion:\n10. Patchy AA has best prognosis:\n    - 50-80% regrow hair within 1 year (some spontaneously)\n    - May recur (30-50% recurrence)\n11. Poor prognostic factors (not present in this patient):\n    - Extensive involvement (alopecia totalis/universalis)\n    - Long duration\n    - Nail involvement (she has mild)\n    - Ophiasis pattern\n    - Young age of onset\n    - Family history\n    - Atopy\n\nMonitoring for Autoimmune Conditions:\n12. Annual thyroid screening (TSH) - association with thyroid disease\n13. Watch for vitiligo\n14. Celiac disease consideration if GI symptoms\n\nNail Changes:\n15. Nail pitting associated with AA\n16. Usually asymptomatic, no treatment needed\n17. May improve with systemic therapy if used\n\nPsychosocial Support:\n18. Acknowledge emotional impact (can be significant)\n19. Offer counseling/support group resources\n20. National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF)\n21. Consider wigs or hairpieces for coverage during treatment\n22. Cosmetic camouflage (hair fibers, scalp makeup)\n23. Screen for anxiety/depression\n\nPatient Education:\n24. AA is autoimmune - not contagious, not caused by stress (stress may trigger)\n25. Hair may regrow even without treatment\n26. Treatment can accelerate regrowth but doesn't change course\n27. Recurrence possible even after complete regrowth\n28. Sun protection for bald areas (sunscreen or hat)\n\nFollow-up:\n29. Return in 4-6 weeks for repeat injections\n30. Assess response at 3-6 months\n31. If progressing or no response: Consider referral to dermatologist specializing in hair loss\n32. Photo documentation to track progress"

Severe nodulocystic acne \u2713\n2. Moderate acne not responding to conventional therapy \u2713\n3. Acne causing scarring \u2713\n4. Acne causing significant psychological distress \u2713\n5. Failed oral antibiotics \u2713\n\nPsychological Impact:\n- Depression screening positive\n- Social avoidance\n- Impact on quality of life\n\n### Plan\nIsotretinoin (Accutane) Therapy:\n1. Initiate isotretinoin (patient is clear candidate)\n2. Dosing:\n   - Start: 0.5 mg/kg/day for first month (40mg/day for this patient)\n   - Target: 1 mg/kg/day (80mg/day)\n   - Cumulative target dose: 120-150 mg/kg total\n3. Duration: Typically 5-6 months\n4. Split dose with fatty meals (absorption enhanced)\n\niPLEDGE Program (Required):\n5. Register patient in iPLEDGE program\n6. Male patients: Monthly check-ins, answer questions\n7. Pregnancy prevention counseling (even for males)\n8. Monthly prescriptions only (30-day supply)\n9. Prescriber and pharmacy must be registered\n\nPre-Treatment Labs:\n10. CBC\n11. Comprehensive metabolic panel (liver function)\n12. Lipid panel (cholesterol, triglycerides)\n13. Consider baseline depression screening documentation\n\nMonitoring During Treatment:\n14. Labs: Lipids and LFTs at baseline, 1 month, then every 2-3 months\n    - Most significant changes occur in first 2 months\n15. Common lab findings:\n    - Elevated triglycerides (expected)\n    - Elevated cholesterol\n    - Transaminitis (usually mild)\n16. Stop if triglycerides >500 (pancreatitis risk) or severe LFT elevation\n\nSide Effect Management:\n17. Dryness (most common and expected):\n    - Lips: Aquaphor or Vaseline frequently (carry at all times)\n    - Skin: Gentle moisturizer (CeraVe, Cetaphil)\n    - Eyes: Artificial tears (may need to avoid contact lenses)\n    - Nose: Saline spray, Vaseline inside nostrils\n18. Sun sensitivity: Strict sunscreen use (SPF 30+)\n19. Muscle/joint pain: Common, especially in athletes\n    - NSAIDs PRN\n    - May need dose reduction\n20. Night vision changes: Rare, counsel about driving at night\n21. Hair thinning: Usually temporary\n\nSerious Side Effects (Rare but Counsel):\n22. Mood changes/depression:\n    - Controversial but FDA warning exists\n    - Monitor closely given pre-existing depression symptoms\n    - Monthly mood assessment\n    - Clear instructions to report mood changes, suicidal thoughts\n    - Consider mental health referral before or during treatment\n23. IBD association: Controversial; report any GI symptoms\n24. Intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): Rare\n    - Avoid concurrent tetracyclines and vitamin A\n    - Report severe headaches, vision changes\n\nMental Health Considerations:\n25. Patient has depression symptoms currently\n26. Options:\n    a. Treat depression first, then isotretinoin\n    b. Start both simultaneously with close monitoring\n    c. Most likely: Acne improvement will improve depression\n27. Refer to mental health provider if needed\n28. Document baseline mood for comparison\n29. Close monitoring with monthly visits provides opportunity for assessment\n30. PHQ-9 at each visit\n\nDuring Treatment:\n31. No blood donation during and for 1 month after\n32. Avoid waxing (fragile skin)\n33. Avoid vitamin A supplements\n34. No additional retinoids\n35. Alcohol in moderation (liver)\n36. No cosmetic procedures during treatment (delayed healing)\n\nInitial Flare:\n37. May worsen first 2-4 weeks (\"purge\")\n38. Warn patient to expect this\n39. May use oral prednisone burst (20-40mg taper) for severe flare\n40. Low starting dose minimizes flare\n\nScarring:\n41. Address after completing isotretinoin (wait 6-12 months)\n42. Options: Chemical peels, microneedling, laser resurfacing\n43. Early treatment prevents more scarring\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n44. ~85% have significant clearing after one course\n45. Some need second course\n46. Post-isotretinoin: Maintain with topical retinoid\n\nFollow-up:\n48. Monthly visits (required for iPLEDGE)\n49. Assess efficacy, side effects, mood\n50. Labs as scheduled\n51. Refill 30-day supply each visit\n52. Complete course before considering stopping"

These may indicate SJS/TEN, DRESS, or anaphylaxis\n\nMonitoring:\n20. Rash should improve within days\n21. If worsening or new symptoms after stopping drug: Return immediately\n22. No labs needed for simple morbilliform eruption\n23. If any concern for DRESS: Repeat CBC with diff, LFTs, BUN/Cr\n\nPatient Education:\n24. This is a drug allergy - not an infection\n25. Must avoid amoxicillin in future\n26. Tell all healthcare providers about this allergy\n27. Consider medical alert bracelet\n28. Keep list of safe and unsafe medications\n29. Rash may get slightly worse before better as drug clears system\n30. Itching can persist even as rash fades\n\nFollow-up:\n31. Return in 1 week if rash not improving\n32. Return immediately if any red flags develop\n33. Allergist referral optional but recommended:\n    - For formal allergy testing if beta-lactam needed in future\n    - To clarify true penicillin allergy vs non-allergic reaction"

Avoid shave biopsy (may transect lesion, compromises Breslow depth)\n\n4. Punch biopsy: Only if excision not feasible (location, size)\n\n5. Procedure today:\n   - Local anesthesia: 1% lidocaine with epinephrine\n   - Elliptical excision with 2 mm margins\n   - Oriented suture for pathology\n   - Sent for dermatopathology\n\n6. Specimen sent with clinical information:\n   - Size, location, clinical description\n   - ABCDE findings\n   - Request staging if melanoma confirmed\n\nPathology Report Will Include:\n\n7. If melanoma confirmed:\n   - Breslow depth (thickness in mm) - most important prognostic factor\n   - Ulceration (present or absent)\n   - Mitotic rate\n   - Margins (involved or clear)\n   - Clark level\n   - Lymphovascular invasion\n   - Regression\n   - Microsatellites\n\nNext Steps Based on Pathology:\n\n8. If benign (dysplastic nevus):\n   - If severely dysplastic with positive margins: Re-excision\n   - Regular skin surveillance\n   - Risk factor modification\n\n9. If melanoma in situ:\n   - Wide local excision (WLE) with 5-10 mm margins\n   - No sentinel lymph node biopsy (no invasion)\n   - Excellent prognosis (cure rate ~100%)\n\n10. If invasive melanoma:\n    - Wide local excision:\n      - Breslow \u22641.0 mm: 1 cm margins\n      - Breslow 1.01-2.0 mm: 1-2 cm margins\n      - Breslow >2.0 mm: 2 cm margins\n    - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB):\n      - Consider for Breslow >0.8 mm or \u22651 mm\n      - Or if high-risk features (ulceration, high mitotic rate)\n\n11. Staging workup (for invasive melanoma):\n    - Physical exam with lymph node palpation\n    - Imaging: CT or PET-CT if advanced (stage III/IV)\n    - LDH level\n\n12. Oncology/surgical oncology referral if invasive melanoma\n\nWound Care Post-Biopsy:\n\n13. Pressure dressing x 24 hours\n14. Keep clean and dry 24 hours\n15. After 24 hours: Wash gently, apply Vaseline, bandage\n16. Suture removal in 10-14 days (back - longer healing)\n17. Signs of infection: Increasing redness, swelling, pus, fever\n\nTimeline:\n\n18. Pathology results: 5-7 business days\n19. Will call patient with results\n20. Return for suture removal and results discussion\n21. If melanoma: Urgent referral to surgical oncology\n\nFull Body Skin Exam:\n\n22. Recommend comprehensive skin exam\n23. Check all moles, entire skin surface\n24. Examine scalp, between toes, soles\n25. Consider scheduling separate full exam visit\n\nRisk Factor Counseling:\n\n26. Sun protection:\n    - SPF 30+ broad-spectrum sunscreen daily\n    - Reapply every 2 hours if outdoors\n    - Protective clothing, wide-brimmed hat\n    - Avoid peak sun (10 AM - 4 PM)\n    - No tanning beds ever\n\n27. Self-skin exams:\n    - Monthly self-exam\n    - Use mirror for back\n    - Know your moles\n    - Report any changing, new, or unusual lesions\n\n28. Regular dermatology surveillance:\n    - Given risk factors: Every 6-12 months skin exam\n    - If melanoma confirmed: More frequent (every 3-6 months initially)\n\nFamily Implications:\n\n29. Family history of melanoma\n30. Counsel family members on sun protection and skin exams\n31. First-degree relatives should have regular skin checks\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n32. Phone call with biopsy results in 5-7 days\n33. Return in 10-14 days for suture removal\n34. Further management based on pathology\n\nPatient Education:\n\n35. Biopsy is necessary to determine if this is melanoma\n36. Early detection of melanoma = excellent prognosis\n37. Will have definitive answer from pathology\n38. Even if melanoma, early stage is very treatable\n39. Sun protection is critical going forward"

Duration: Several hours (depends on tumor extent)\n\n10. Reconstruction options:\n    - Primary closure (if small defect)\n    - Local flap (common for nasal ala)\n    - Skin graft (if needed)\n    - May involve reconstructive surgeon collaboration\n\nPre-Procedure:\n\n11. Anticoagulation:\n    - Patient not on blood thinners (no adjustment needed)\n    - If on aspirin/warfarin: Discuss with Mohs surgeon\n\n12. Diabetes optimization:\n    - HbA1c checked (7.2% - acceptable for surgery)\n    - Good glucose control promotes healing\n\n13. Pre-op instructions from Mohs office\n\nPost-Mohs Care:\n\n14. Wound care per surgeon instructions\n15. May have drain, dressing\n16. Activity restrictions initially\n17. Sun protection essential\n18. Suture removal timing per surgeon\n\nRecurrence Risk:\n\n19. Mohs cure rate: 99% for primary BCC\n20. Low recurrence expected with clear margins\n21. Follow-up for surveillance important\n\nSurveillance After Treatment:\n\n22. History of BCC increases risk of additional skin cancers\n23. 40-50% will develop another BCC within 5 years\n24. Full body skin exam every 6-12 months\n25. Patient self-exams monthly\n26. Examine treated site for recurrence\n\nSun Protection:\n\n27. Critical for preventing new cancers\n28. SPF 30+ daily to face and exposed skin\n29. Wide-brimmed hat outdoors\n30. Protective clothing (UPF clothing for landscaping)\n31. Avoid midday sun\n32. No tanning beds\n\nFull Body Skin Exam:\n\n33. Performed today - no other suspicious lesions\n34.

Labs to consider:\n   - CBC with differential (rule out eosinophilia, infection)\n   - CMP\n   - TSH, anti-TPO (thyroid autoimmunity associated with CSU)\n   - ESR, CRP (screen for inflammation, vasculitis)\n\n2. If suspected urticarial vasculitis (not this patient):\n   - Skin biopsy of active lesion\n   - Complement levels\n\n3. If angioedema prominent with family history:\n   - C4 level (screening for HAE)\n   - C1 inhibitor level and function (if C4 low)\n   - This patient: No family history, acquired likely, but can screen\n\n4. Ordered: CBC, CMP, TSH, anti-TPO, ESR, CRP, C4\n\nFirst-Line Treatment (Modern Antihistamines):\n\n5. Second-generation H1 antihistamine - INCREASE DOSE\n   - Current: Cetirizine 10 mg daily (not controlling)\n   - Increase to: Cetirizine 10 mg BID (twice daily) or\n   - Up to 4x standard dose (40 mg/day) approved in guidelines for CSU\n\n6. Alternative antihistamines (if one not effective, try another):\n   - Fexofenadine 180 mg daily to BID\n   - Loratadine 10 mg daily to BID\n   - Desloratadine, levocetirizine\n\n7. Plan: Cetirizine 10 mg twice daily (20 mg total)\n   - If still not controlled in 2-4 weeks, increase to 20 mg BID (40 mg total)\n\nSecond-Line (Add-On If Antihistamine Inadequate):\n\n8. If high-dose antihistamine not sufficient, add:\n   - H2 blocker: Famotidine 20 mg BID (may provide additive benefit)\n   - Leukotriene modifier: Montelukast 10 mg daily\n   - These are less effective but may help as adjuncts\n\n9. Consider adding: Montelukast 10 mg daily (added today)\n\nThird-Line (For Refractory CSU):\n\n10. If fails high-dose antihistamine + adjuncts:\n    - Omalizumab (Xolair): Anti-IgE monoclonal antibody\n    - FDA-approved for chronic urticaria\n    - 300 mg SQ monthly\n    - Very effective (60-70% response)\n    - Dermatology/Allergy referral for biologic therapy\n\n11. Other options (less commonly used):\n    - Cyclosporine (severe refractory cases)\n    - Dapsone\n    - Short course oral steroids for severe flares (not long-term)\n\nManagement of Angioedema Episodes:\n\n12. Current angioedema is histamine-mediated (associated with urticaria)\n    - Responds to antihistamines, steroids, epinephrine if severe\n    - Different from bradykinin-mediated (HAE)\n\n13. For future angioedema episodes:\n    - Take extra antihistamine\n    - Prednisone burst if severe (see below)\n    - Seek emergency care if: Throat swelling, difficulty breathing/swallowing, hoarse voice\n\n14. Prescribe: Prednisone 40 mg for 3-5 days (for severe flares/angioedema) - use sparingly\n\n15. Prescribe: EpiPen if angioedema recurrent or high concern for progression\n    - Use if throat involvement, difficulty breathing\n    - Go to ER after use\n\nEducation:\n\n16. Avoid triggers if identified (heat, stress may worsen)\n17. Avoid NSAIDs (can exacerbate urticaria) - use acetaminophen instead\n18. Avoid ACE inhibitors (can cause angioedema)\n19. Tight clothing may worsen (pressure urticaria component)\n20. Alcohol may worsen (vasodilation)\n\nPrognosis:\n\n21. CSU often resolves over time:\n    - ~50% resolve within 1 year\n    - ~80% resolve within 5 years\n    - Some persist longer\n\n22. Treatment may be needed long-term\n23. Not allergic in traditional sense - not dangerous to organs\n24. Angioedema usually mild in CSU (different from HAE)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n25. Return in 4 weeks:\n    - Review lab results\n    - Assess antihistamine response\n    - Adjust treatment as needed\n    - Consider biologic if not controlled\n\n26. Allergy/Immunology or Dermatology referral if:\n    - Not controlled with high-dose antihistamines\n    - For omalizumab consideration\n    - Diagnostic uncertainty\n\nCurrent Prescriptions:\n\n27. Cetirizine 10 mg, take 1 tab twice daily\n28. Montelukast 10 mg, take 1 tab daily\n29. Prednisone 20 mg, take 2 tabs daily for severe flares x 3-5 days (PRN)\n30. EpiPen 0.3 mg, use for throat swelling or breathing difficulty\n\nPatient Education:\n\n31. Chronic urticaria is frustrating but treatable\n32. Usually not allergic - no need for extensive allergy testing\n33. Safe to take higher doses of antihistamines\n34. Control is goal while waiting for natural resolution\n35. Seek emergency care if throat involved with angioedema"

Reports:\n- Toenails becoming thick, yellow, crumbly\n- Started in big toe, now involves 3 toenails\n- Cosmetically distressing\n- Some mild discomfort with shoes\n- No pain, no discharge, no cellulitis\n- Fingernails normal\n\nRisk factors: Uses shared gym showers, gets pedicures regularly\n\nNo prior treatment for this\n\nPast Medical History: None\nMedications: OCP\nAllergies: NKDA\nSocial: Personal trainer, otherwise healthy\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 112/70, HR 68\n\nNail Exam (Toenails):\n- Right great toe: Distal subungual involvement, yellow discoloration, subungual hyperkeratosis (debris), onycholysis (separation from bed), ~60% nail involvement\n- Right 2nd toe: Similar changes, ~40% involvement\n- Left great toe: Early changes, distal yellow discoloration, ~20% involvement\n- Other toenails: Normal\n- Fingernails: Normal\n\nFeet: Mild scaling between toes (likely tinea pedis), no cellulitis, no paronychia\n\nPopliteal/inguinal lymph nodes: Not enlarged\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Onychomycosis (Dermatophyte), Toenails, Bilateral (ICD-10: B35.1)\n\nPattern: Distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO) - most common type\n\nSeverity: Moderate (>50% nail involvement in one nail)\n\nConcurrent: Tinea pedis (athletes foot) - common association\n\n### Plan\nConfirm Diagnosis:\n\n1. Nail clipping for fungal studies:\n   - KOH prep (quick, in office if available)\n   - Fungal culture (takes 4-6 weeks, identifies species)\n   - PAS stain (if available, more sensitive than KOH)\n\n2. Reason: Confirm fungal etiology before systemic treatment\n   - Only 50% of dystrophic nails are fungal\n   - Psoriasis, trauma, lichen planus can mimic\n\n3. Nail clipping sent today for culture\n\nTreatment Options Discussed:\n\n4. Oral antifungal therapy (MOST EFFECTIVE):\n   - Terbinafine 250 mg daily x 12 weeks (for toenails)\n   - Cure rate: 70-80%\n   - Requires baseline LFTs (hepatotoxicity risk)\n   - Drug interactions: CYP2D6 inhibitor\n   - Side effects: GI upset, taste disturbance, rare hepatotoxicity, rare blood dyscrasias\n\n5. Alternative oral: Itraconazole\n   - Pulse dosing: 200 mg BID x 1 week/month x 3-4 months\n   - Or continuous: 200 mg daily x 12 weeks\n   - More drug interactions than terbinafine\n   - Negative inotrope - avoid in heart failure\n\n6. Topical antifungals (less effective but safer):\n   - Efinaconazole 10% solution (Jublia): Daily x 48 weeks, 15-18% cure rate\n   - Tavaborole 5% solution (Kerydin): Daily x 48 weeks, 6-9% cure rate\n   - Ciclopirox 8% lacquer (Penlac): Daily x 48 weeks, 5-12% cure rate\n   - Expensive, low efficacy, but no systemic side effects\n\n7. Combination therapy (oral + topical): May improve outcomes\n\n8. Laser therapy: Variable evidence, not consistently effective, expensive\n\n9. Nail removal: Rarely needed, can be combined with antifungals\n\nPatient Preference and Plan:\n\n10. Patient prefers oral therapy for higher efficacy\n11. Plan: Terbinafine 250 mg daily x 12 weeks (start after culture confirmation)\n\n12. Pre-treatment labs:\n    - CBC\n    - LFTs (AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin)\n    - CMP\n\n13. If labs normal and culture positive: Start terbinafine\n\n14. Monitoring:\n    - Repeat LFTs at 6 weeks\n    - Sooner if symptoms: Fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pale stool\n\nTinea Pedis (Concurrent):\n\n15. Treat athlete's foot to prevent reinfection of nails\n16. Terbinafine 1% cream or clotrimazole 1% cream BID x 2-4 weeks\n17. Apply between toes and to affected areas\n18. Treatment of tinea pedis will be covered by oral terbinafine too\n\nNail Care:\n\n19. Keep nails trimmed short\n20. File down thickened areas (debridement helps topicals penetrate)\n21. Podiatry referral for debridement if significant hyperkeratosis\n22. Don't pick or traumatize nails\n\nPrevention of Reinfection:\n\n23. Keep feet dry\n24. Moisture-wicking socks, change if sweaty\n25. Antifungal powder in shoes\n26. Alternate shoes (allow to dry)\n27. Wear sandals in shared showers, pools, gyms\n28. Avoid barefoot in public areas\n29. Disinfect or discard old shoes at end of treatment\n30. Bring own tools to pedicure or ensure salon sterilizes properly\n31. Consider stopping pedicures during treatment or use own tools\n\nRealistic Expectations:\n\n32. New healthy nail takes 12-18 months to grow out (toenails)\n33. Cosmetic improvement lags behind mycological cure\n34. Will not see normal-appearing nail until full regrowth\n35. Cure rates: 70-80% with terbinafine\n36. Recurrence: 15-20% over years (reinfection common)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n37. Return in 2 weeks:\n    - Review culture results\n    - Review labs\n    - Start terbinafine if appropriate\n\n38. Follow-up at 6 weeks:\n    - Repeat LFTs\n    - Assess tolerance\n\n39. End of treatment (12 weeks):\n    - Assess clinical response (may still look abnormal)\n    - Repeat culture if needed (to confirm cure)\n\n40. Long-term: Monitor for healthy nail regrowth over 12-18 months\n\nPrescriptions (to start after labs/culture):\n\n41. Terbinafine 250 mg, 1 daily x 12 weeks (dispense 84 tabs)\n42. Clotrimazole 1% cream, apply between toes BID x 4 weeks\n\nPatient Education:\n\n43. Nail fungus is common and treatable but requires long treatment\n44. Oral medication is most effective\n45. New nail grows slowly - patience required\n46. Prevent reinfection with good foot hygiene\n47. Call if symptoms of liver problems"

Start antiviral IMMEDIATELY\n   - Valacyclovir 1000 mg TID x 7 days (preferred - better absorption)\n   - OR Acyclovir 800 mg 5 times daily x 7 days\n   - OR Famciclovir 500 mg TID x 7 days\n\n2. Prescribing: Valacyclovir 1000 mg, 1 tab 3 times daily x 7 days\n\n3. Start within 72 hours of rash onset (patient is at 72 hours - START NOW)\n   - Reduces duration of rash\n   - Reduces severity and duration of acute pain\n   - May reduce risk of PHN\n\n4. Complete full 7-day course even if symptoms improve\n\nPain Management:\n\n5. Acute pain control is important:\n   - Acetaminophen 1000 mg every 6 hours scheduled\n   - Ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hours with food\n   - Combination often needed\n\n6. If inadequate:\n   - Add gabapentin 300 mg TID (for neuropathic pain)\n   - Titrate as needed\n   - May help prevent PHN\n\n7. Severe pain:\n   - Short course opioid: Hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325, 1-2 tabs q4-6h PRN\n   - Use for shortest duration possible\n\n8. Prescribing:\n   - Acetaminophen 650 mg, 2 tabs q6h scheduled\n   - Gabapentin 300 mg TID (start, can titrate up)\n   - Hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325, 1-2 tabs q4-6h PRN for breakthrough (#20)\n\nTopical Therapy:\n\n9. Keep rash clean and dry\n10. Calamine lotion for comfort\n11. Cool compresses with water or Burow's solution\n12. Don't break vesicles (infection risk)\n13. Lidocaine 5% patch (Lidoderm) can help localized pain - apply to affected area\n14. Capsaicin: Not in acute phase, may help later for PHN\n\nInfection Prevention:\n\n15. Shingles is contagious to non-immune individuals:\n    - Can cause chickenpox in those who haven't had it/unvaccinated\n    - Contagious until all lesions crusted over\n\n16. Avoid contact with:\n    - Pregnant women (who haven't had chickenpox)\n    - Immunocompromised individuals\n    - Newborns\n    - Anyone who hasn't had chickenpox or vaccine\n\n17. Cover rash with clothing or bandage when around others\n18. Good hand hygiene\n\nWork/Activity:\n\n19. Can work if can cover lesions and avoid vulnerable individuals\n20. No isolation required once lesions covered\n21. Activity as tolerated\n\nMonitoring for Complications:\n\n22. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN):\n    - Pain persisting >90 days after rash\n    - Risk: 10-15% at age 50, higher with age\n    - Treatment: Gabapentin/pregabalin, TCAs, lidocaine patches, capsaicin\n\n23. Secondary bacterial infection:\n    - Watch for: Increasing redness, swelling, pus, fever\n    - If develops: Antibiotics needed\n\n24. Disseminated zoster:\n    - >20 vesicles outside primary dermatome\n    - Requires hospitalization and IV antiviral\n    - More common in immunocompromised\n\n25. Eye involvement (if facial/V1):\n    - Not present in this patient\n    - If develops: URGENT ophthalmology referral\n\nDiabetes Consideration:\n\n26. Healing may be slightly slower in diabetic\n27. Monitor for secondary infection\n28. Blood glucose control important\n\nVaccination:\n\n29. After this episode resolves:\n    - Recommend Shingrix vaccine (recombinant zoster vaccine)\n    - 2 doses, 2-6 months apart\n    - >90% effective at preventing future shingles and PHN\n    - Wait until acute episode resolved (usually wait a few months)\n\n30. Should have had Shingrix at age 50 (recommended 50+)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n31. Return in 7-10 days:\n    - Assess healing\n    - Evaluate for secondary infection\n    - Assess pain control\n\n32. Call or return sooner if:\n    - Spreading rash (dissemination)\n    - Signs of infection (increasing redness, pus, fever)\n    - Eye involvement (redness, vision changes)\n    - Worsening pain despite medications\n    - Neurological symptoms\n\nPatient Education:\n\n33. Shingles is reactivation of chickenpox virus\n34. Antivirals work best started early - starting now\n35. Pain may last weeks even after rash heals\n36. Rash typically heals in 2-4 weeks\n37. Contagious - cover rash, avoid vulnerable individuals\n38. Get Shingrix vaccine after recovery to prevent future episodes"

Consider overnight admission for severe cases\n\nAFTER STABILIZATION:\n\n20. Remove stinger if still present (scrape, don't squeeze)\n21. Ice to sting site\n22. Reassess frequently\n\nDISCHARGE PLANNING (After Observation):\n\n23. Epinephrine Auto-Injector Prescription:\n    - EpiPen 0.3 mg (or equivalent) x 2\n    - Train patient on use\n    - Carry at all times\n    - Use immediately for future reactions, then call 911\n\n24. Prescription: EpiPen 0.3 mg auto-injector, pack of 2, use one IM into outer thigh for allergic reaction, call 911 after use\n\n25. Short course oral steroids:\n    - Prednisone 50 mg daily x 3-5 days (reduces biphasic risk)\n\n26. Oral antihistamines:\n    - Cetirizine 10 mg daily or Diphenhydramine 25-50 mg q6h PRN x 3-5 days\n\nREFERRALS:\n\n27. Allergist referral MANDATORY:\n    - Confirm insect venom allergy with testing\n    - Consider Venom Immunotherapy (VIT)\n    - 85-95% effective at preventing future anaphylaxis\n\n28. Medical alert bracelet recommendation\n\nPATIENT EDUCATION:\n\n29. Anaphylaxis is life-threatening\n30. Always carry EpiPen\n31. Use EpiPen FIRST for any symptoms (don't wait)\n32. Call 911 after using EpiPen (may need more treatment)\n33. Avoid areas with bees if possible\n34. Wear protective clothing outdoors\n35. Do not consume food/drinks that attract bees\n36. Allergist can desensitize with immunotherapy\n\nRETURN PRECAUTIONS:\n\n37. Return immediately if: Swelling, hives, difficulty breathing, dizziness, throat tightness\n38. May occur up to 72 hours (biphasic reaction)\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n\n39. PCP within 1 week\n40. Allergist within 4-6 weeks\n41. Consider repeat EpiPen training"

Admit for continuous telemetry monitoring\n2. Keep defibrillator readily available\n3. IV access\n4. Avoid AV nodal blocking agents (see below)\n\nMEDICATION PRECAUTIONS IN WPW:\n\n5. AVOID in WPW with pre-excitation:\n   - Beta-blockers (in acute setting with tachycardia)\n   - Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil)\n   - Adenosine\n   - Digoxin\n   \n6. Reason: These block AV node but NOT accessory pathway\n   - If patient develops AFib, blocking AV node forces conduction over accessory pathway \u2192 very rapid ventricular rates \u2192 VFib\n\n7. Safe medications if needed:\n   - Procainamide, Ibutilide, Amiodarone (slow accessory pathway)\n   - Electrical cardioversion is safest for unstable tachycardia\n\nELECTROPHYSIOLOGY (EP) STUDY:\n\n8. EP study is INDICATED and URGENT:\n   - WPW + syncope = high-risk\n   - EP study will:\n     a) Confirm presence and location of accessory pathway\n     b) Measure refractory period of pathway\n     c) Induce tachycardias to assess risk\n     d) Potentially ablate pathway in same session\n\n9. Consult electrophysiology urgently\n\n10. Catheter ablation of accessory pathway:\n    - Curative in 95%+ of cases\n    - Low risk procedure\n    - Recommended for symptomatic WPW, especially with syncope\n\nRISK STRATIFICATION (During EP Study):\n\n11. High-risk features:\n    - Short accessory pathway refractory period (<250 ms)\n    - Able to induce AFib with rapid ventricular response\n    - Multiple pathways\n    - Inducible sustained tachycardia\n\n12. If high-risk: Ablation strongly recommended\n\nIF TACHYCARDIA OCCURS WHILE ADMITTED:\n\n13. Narrow complex regular tachycardia (AVRT orthodromic):\n    - Vagal maneuvers (if stable)\n    - If unstable: Cardioversion\n    - Procainamide or cardioversion preferred\n\n14. Wide complex tachycardia (AVRT antidromic or pre-excited AFib):\n    - ASSUME it is pre-excited AFib until proven otherwise\n    - Hemodynamically stable: Procainamide 15-18 mg/kg IV\n    - Hemodynamically unstable: Immediate synchronized cardioversion\n    - DO NOT give AV nodal blockers\n\n15. Atrial fibrillation with WPW (wide, irregular, rapid):\n    - Very dangerous - can degenerate to VFib\n    - Immediate cardioversion if unstable\n    - Procainamide or Ibutilide if stable\n\nECHOCARDIOGRAM:\n\n16. Echocardiogram to assess:\n    - LV function\n    - Structural heart disease\n    - Ebstein's anomaly (associated with WPW)\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n\n17. Cousin with sudden death at 35:\n    - Concerning for familial condition\n    - WPW can be associated with familial sudden death\n    - Consider screening family members for WPW (ECG)\n\nPOST-ABLATION (IF SUCCESSFUL):\n\n18. After successful ablation:\n    - No delta wave on ECG\n    - Curative, no restrictions\n    - No long-term medications needed\n    - Low recurrence rate (3-5%)\n\nIF ABLATION NOT POSSIBLE/DECLINED:\n\n19. Medical management for chronic suppression:\n    - Flecainide or Propafenone (in structurally normal heart)\n    - Amiodarone (more side effects)\n    - ICD may be considered if high-risk and not ablated\n\n20. Avoid:\n    - Alcohol (AFib trigger)\n    - Stimulants\n    - Dehydration\n\nACTIVITY:\n\n21. No driving until cleared (syncope restrictions)\n22. After ablation: Full activity allowed\n\nPATIENT EDUCATION:\n\n23. WPW is an extra electrical connection in the heart\n24. Can cause fast heart rhythms and fainting\n25. In rare cases, can cause dangerous rhythms\n26. Ablation is curative for most patients\n27. If palpitations before ablation: Lie down, call 911\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n\n28. EP study and likely ablation during this admission\n29. Post-ablation ECG to confirm loss of pre-excitation\n30. Cardiology/EP follow-up in 2-4 weeks post-procedure"

Once stable: Check TFTs every 2-3 months, then every 3-6 months\n\n10. CBC with differential:\n    - Baseline obtained (normal)\n    - Monitor if symptoms of infection (agranulocytosis risk)\n    - Check immediately if: Fever, sore throat, mouth sores\n\n11. LFTs:\n    - Baseline: Normal\n    - Monitor periodically (hepatotoxicity rare)\n\nSide Effects of Methimazole to Monitor:\n\n12. Common: Rash, itching, GI upset, arthralgias\n13. Rare but serious:\n    - Agranulocytosis (0.2-0.5%): EMERGENCY if fever, sore throat\n    - Hepatotoxicity\n    - Vasculitis\n\n14. Stop drug and seek immediate care if:\n    - Fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers (agranulocytosis)\n    - Jaundice, dark urine (liver)\n    - Severe rash\n\nGraves' Ophthalmopathy:\n\n15. Mild eye involvement noted:\n    - Lid lag, mild proptosis, conjunctival irritation\n    - No vision changes, no diplopia\n\n16. Management:\n    - Artificial tears for dryness (4-6 times daily)\n    - Sunglasses outdoors\n    - Elevate head of bed\n    - Smoking cessation (critical - worsens TAO)\n\n17. Ophthalmology referral for baseline evaluation\n\n18. If worsens (severe proptosis, diplopia, vision changes): Urgent ophthalmology, steroids, possible orbital decompression\n\n19. RAI may worsen ophthalmopathy - important consideration if definitive therapy needed later\n\nDefinitive Therapy (If ATD Fails/Relapse):\n\n20. Radioactive iodine (RAI):\n    - Destroys thyroid tissue\n    - Single dose usually effective\n    - Results in permanent hypothyroidism (lifelong levothyroxine)\n    - Contraindicated in pregnancy\n    - May worsen eye disease (can pretreat with steroids)\n\n21. Thyroidectomy:\n    - Surgical removal\n    - Rapid, definitive\n    - Risks: Hypoparathyroidism, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury\n    - Preferred if large goiter, coexisting nodule, or RAI contraindicated\n\n22. Discussion of definitive options deferred for now - trial of ATD first\n\nLifestyle:\n\n23. SMOKING CESSATION - critical (patient is ex-smoker - reinforce)\n24. Avoid iodine excess (contrast, kelp supplements)\n25. Balanced diet, adequate calcium/vitamin D (hyperthyroidism causes bone loss)\n26. Manage stress\n\nCardiac Considerations:\n\n27. Age 62 with tachycardia - monitor for atrial fibrillation\n28. If palpitations worsen or irregular pulse: ECG to rule out AF\n29. Beta-blocker also helps with rate control if AF develops\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n30. Return in 4-6 weeks:\n    - Check TFTs\n    - Assess symptom improvement\n    - Adjust methimazole dose\n    - CBC check if any symptoms\n\n31. Ophthalmology appointment within 2-4 weeks\n\n32. Endocrinology referral for ongoing Graves' management\n\nPrescriptions:\n\n33. Methimazole 10 mg, take 2 tabs (20 mg) once daily\n34. Metoprolol tartrate 50 mg, take 1 tab TID\n35. Artificial tears, use 4-6 times daily for eye comfort\n\nPatient Education:\n\n36. Graves' disease is autoimmune hyperthyroidism\n37. Treatment options exist - trying medication first\n38. Takes 4-8 weeks to feel better\n39. Watch for: Fever, sore throat (agranulocytosis) - stop med, seek care\n40. Long-term plan will depend on response to medication"

        "output": "### Subjective\nPatient is a 45-year-old female referred for thyroid nodule evaluation. Reports:\n- Incidentally found on CT scan of neck (done for unrelated reason - trauma)\n- CT showed 2.2 cm right thyroid nodule\n- No neck swelling noticed by patient\n- No difficulty swallowing or breathing\n- No hoarseness\n- No hyperthyroid symptoms (no palpitations, weight loss, tremor, heat intolerance)\n- No hypothyroid symptoms (no fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance)\n\nNo history of head/neck radiation. No family history of thyroid cancer.\n\nPast Medical History: Anxiety, GERD\nMedications: Sertraline 50 mg, omeprazole 20 mg\nAllergies: NKDA\nSocial: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 122/78, HR 72, Weight 155 lbs\n\nNeck Exam:\n- Thyroid: Palpable nodule right lobe, ~2 cm, firm, mobile, non-tender\n- No left-sided nodules palpated\n- No cervical lymphadenopathy\n- Trachea midline\n\nGeneral: Appears well, no signs of hyper/hypothyroidism\n\nLabs:\n- TSH: 2.1 mIU/L (normal)\n- Free T4: 1.1 ng/dL (normal)\n\nCT Report (reviewed): 2.2 cm right thyroid nodule, no concerning features described but limited evaluation on CT\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Right Thyroid Nodule (ICD-10: E04.1)\n\nRisk Stratification for Malignancy:\n- Size: 2.2 cm (>1 cm, requires workup)\n- History: No radiation exposure, no family history of thyroid cancer\n- Exam: Firm, mobile (no fixation)\n- TSH: Normal (not suppressed, so not hyperfunctioning)\n- Need: Thyroid ultrasound for characterization, then FNA based on findings\n\n### Plan\nThyroid Ultrasound:\n\n1. Order thyroid ultrasound (most important next step)\n2. Superior to CT for thyroid nodule evaluation\n3. Will assess:\n   - Nodule size, characteristics\n   - Solid vs cystic\n   - Echogenicity (hypoechoic suspicious)\n   - Margins (irregular suspicious)\n   - Calcifications (microcalcifications suspicious)\n   - Vascularity\n   - Cervical lymph nodes\n\n4. TI-RADS scoring (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System):\n   - Classifies nodules by sonographic features\n   - Determines need for FNA\n\nFine Needle Aspiration (FNA) Biopsy:\n\n5. Indications for FNA (based on US findings):\n   - Highly suspicious (TI-RADS 5): FNA if \u22651 cm\n   - Intermediate suspicious (TI-RADS 4): FNA if \u22651.5 cm\n   - Mildly suspicious (TI-RADS 3): FNA if \u22652.5 cm\n   - Not suspicious (TI-RADS 2): FNA if \u22652.5 cm or observation\n   - Benign (TI-RADS 1): No FNA\n\n6. Patient's nodule is 2.2 cm - FNA likely indicated depending on US appearance\n\n7. FNA will provide cytology:\n   - Bethesda classification I-VI\n   - Determines if benign, indeterminate, suspicious, or malignant\n\nThyroid Function:\n\n8. TSH normal - euthyroid\n9. Nodule is not hyperfunctioning (if TSH were low, would order thyroid uptake scan)\n10. No thyroid medication needed currently\n\nCalcitonin:\n\n11. Routine calcitonin not recommended (controversial)\n12. Consider if: Family history of MTC/MEN2, suspicious nodule for medullary carcinoma\n13. Not ordered currently\n\nRisk Factors Reviewed:\n\n14. Lower risk:\n    - Female (though cancer can occur)\n    - No radiation history\n    - No family history of thyroid cancer\n    - No symptoms of compression\n    - Normal TSH\n\n15. Higher risk features (not present):\n    - Rapid growth\n    - Fixed nodule\n    - Lymphadenopathy\n    - Hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement)\n    - Very young or older age\n    - Male sex\n    - History of radiation\n\nPatient Reassurance:\n\n16. Most thyroid nodules are benign (>90%)\n17. Systematic workup will determine nature of nodule\n18. Even if thyroid cancer, most are highly treatable with excellent prognosis\n\nNext Steps:\n\n19. Ultrasound scheduled within 1-2 weeks\n20. Results will determine if FNA needed\n21. If FNA needed: Can be done by radiology or endocrinology (US-guided preferred)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n22. Return after ultrasound results available:\n    - Review findings\n    - Discuss FNA if indicated\n    - May refer to endocrinology for FNA\n\n23. Endocrinology referral:\n    - For FNA and ongoing nodule management\n    - Especially if FNA shows indeterminate or suspicious results\n\nIf Ultrasound Shows Low-Risk Nodule:\n\n24. May observe with surveillance ultrasound\n25. Repeat US in 12-24 months depending on TI-RADS score\n26. Interval increase in size: Consider FNA\n\nIf FNA Results:\n\n27. Bethesda I (Non-diagnostic): Repeat FNA\n28. Bethesda II (Benign): Surveillance\n29. Bethesda III (Atypia/follicular lesion of undetermined significance): Molecular testing or repeat FNA or lobectomy\n30. Bethesda IV (Follicular neoplasm): Usually surgery (lobectomy)\n31. Bethesda V (Suspicious for malignancy): Surgery (lobectomy or total thyroidectomy)\n32. Bethesda VI (Malignant): Surgery\n\nPatient Education:\n\n33. Thyroid nodules very common (50% of adults have them on imaging)\n34. Most are benign\n35. Ultrasound and possible FNA will clarify\n36. No immediate treatment needed while working up\n37. Will discuss results and next steps at follow-up"

Wait 30-60 minutes before eating, coffee, other medications\n7. Separate from calcium, iron, antacids by 4 hours (reduce absorption)\n8. Take consistently at same time daily\n9. Don't skip doses; if missed, take as soon as remembered (don't double)\n\nMonitoring:\n\n10. Recheck TSH in 6-8 weeks:\n    - Takes 4-6 weeks for TSH to reach new steady state\n    - Goal TSH: 0.5-2.5 mIU/L (lower half of normal range)\n    - Adjust levothyroxine by 12.5-25 mcg increments based on TSH\n\n11. Titration:\n    - If TSH still high: Increase dose\n    - If TSH low (overcorrected): Decrease dose\n    - Continue adjustments every 6-8 weeks until stable\n\n12. Once stable: Check TSH annually (or sooner if symptoms change)\n\nSymptom Improvement Timeline:\n\n13. Energy and fatigue: May improve in 2-4 weeks\n14. Weight: Gradual, may take months (lifestyle still important)\n15. Cold intolerance, constipation: Weeks to months\n16. Hair/skin: 3-6 months (hair growth cycle)\n17. Complete symptom resolution: 3-6 months typically\n\nHyperlipidemia:\n\n18. LDL 160 - elevated, likely secondary to hypothyroidism\n19. Defer statin therapy - recheck lipids after euthyroid (3-6 months)\n20. Lipids often improve with thyroid hormone replacement\n21. If persistently elevated when euthyroid: Consider statin\n\nAnemia:\n\n22. Macrocytic anemia - check B12, folate\n23. Autoimmune thyroid disease associated with:\n    - Pernicious anemia (B12 deficiency)\n    - Celiac disease\n24. Order: B12, folate levels\n25. If B12 low: B12 supplementation\n26. Recheck CBC when euthyroid\n\nOther Autoimmune Associations:\n\n27. Hashimoto's can be associated with:\n    - Type 1 diabetes\n    - Celiac disease\n    - Vitiligo\n    - Addison's disease\n28. Monitor for symptoms of other autoimmune conditions\n29. Celiac screening if GI symptoms persist after treatment\n\nMenstrual Irregularities:\n\n30. Heavy, irregular periods common in hypothyroidism\n31. Should normalize with treatment\n32. If persists after euthyroid: Gynecology evaluation\n\nPregnancy Consideration:\n\n33. Patient is reproductive age\n34. If planning pregnancy:\n    - TSH goal <2.5 mIU/L preconception\n    - Levothyroxine requirements increase 25-30% in pregnancy\n    - Check TSH once pregnancy confirmed, increase dose empirically\n    - Close monitoring throughout pregnancy\n\n35. Counsel on importance of notifying if becomes pregnant\n\nLifestyle:\n\n36. Diet: Balanced, no specific restrictions\n37. Iodine: Usually adequate in diet (iodized salt)\n38. Supplements: Avoid high-dose iodine/kelp supplements\n39. Exercise: Start slowly, increase as energy improves\n40. Weight loss: May occur naturally with treatment, but lifestyle still important\n\nMedication Interactions:\n\n41. Separate from:\n    - Calcium, iron supplements (4 hours)\n    - Antacids, PPIs (affect absorption)\n    - Cholestyramine, sucralfate\n\n42. Drugs that may increase levothyroxine need:\n    - Estrogen (oral contraceptives)\n    - Pregnancy\n    - Medications increasing TBG\n\n43. Tell providers about levothyroxine when prescribed new medications\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n44. Return in 6-8 weeks:\n    - Recheck TSH\n    - Assess symptom improvement\n    - Adjust dose if needed\n\n45.

MRI pituitary (with and without contrast):\n   - Rule out pituitary adenoma\n   - Indicated for secondary hypogonadism\n   - Especially if prolactin elevated or visual symptoms (not present here)\n   - Ordering given hypogonadotropic picture\n\n2. Additional labs if not done:\n   - Ferritin (hemochromatosis can cause hypogonadism)\n   - Consider: Estradiol, cortisol (if pituitary workup indicated)\n\n3. Assess for contributing factors:\n   - Obesity: Major contributor\n   - OSA: On CPAP (optimize compliance)\n   - Medications: None causing this (opioids, steroids can)\n   - Alcohol: Moderate (contributing but not primary cause)\n\nLifestyle Optimization (First-Line):\n\n4. Weight loss:\n   - Can significantly increase testosterone naturally\n   - Goal: 10% weight loss (23 lbs)\n   - Even 5-10% can raise testosterone 50-100 ng/dL\n   - Calorie restriction + exercise\n\n5. Exercise:\n   - Resistance training: Increases testosterone\n   - Aerobic exercise: Helps weight loss\n   - 150 min/week aerobic + 2-3 days resistance\n\n6. Sleep:\n   - Optimize OSA treatment (CPAP compliance)\n   - Poor sleep lowers testosterone\n   - Is patient using CPAP every night? (Verify)\n\n7. Reduce alcohol (moderate use OK but less is better)\n\nTestosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) Discussion:\n\n8. Indications for TRT:\n   - Symptomatic hypogonadism \u2713\n   - Confirmed low testosterone (2 morning levels) \u2713\n   - After addressing reversible causes \u2713 (ongoing)\n\n9. Consider trial of lifestyle first, but given significant symptoms, may offer TRT\n\n10. TRT options:\n    a) Topical gel (Androgel, Testim, Fortesta): Daily application, steady levels\n    b) IM injection (Testosterone cypionate/enanthate): Every 1-2 weeks, peaks and troughs\n    c) Subcutaneous pellets: Every 3-6 months, minor procedure\n    d) Nasal gel (Natesto): TID dosing\n    e) Oral (Jatenzo): BID with food\n\n11. Starting TRT: Testosterone cypionate 100 mg IM weekly\n    - OR topical testosterone gel 1.62%, 2-4 pumps daily to shoulders\n    - Patient preference: Injections (fewer daily concerns)\n\nContraindications to TRT Reviewed:\n\n12. No contraindications present:\n    - No prostate cancer (PSA normal, no symptoms)\n    - No breast cancer\n    - Hematocrit <54% \u2713\n    - No severe OSA (on CPAP, treated) \u2713\n    - No uncontrolled heart failure\n    - No plans for fertility currently (TRT suppresses spermatogenesis)\n\n13. Fertility counseling:\n    - TRT suppresses sperm production\n    - If fertility desired: Use hCG, clomiphene (off-label) instead of TRT\n    - Patient: Not planning more children (vasectomy done) - can proceed with TRT\n\nMonitoring on TRT:\n\n14. Baseline labs:\n    - Testosterone: 245, 262 (documented low)\n    - Hematocrit: 42%\n    - PSA: 1.2\n    - Lipids: Elevated LDL\n\n15. Follow-up labs at 3-6 months on TRT:\n    - Total testosterone (trough, morning before next injection)\n    - Goal: 400-700 ng/dL (mid-normal, symptom improvement)\n    - Hematocrit (can rise with TRT - polycythemia risk)\n    - PSA\n    - Lipid panel\n\n16. Monitoring schedule:\n    - 3 months: Testosterone, CBC, PSA\n    - 6 months: Repeat above + symptoms\n    - Then every 6-12 months when stable\n\n17. Watch for:\n    - Polycythemia (Hct >54%): May need phlebotomy or dose reduction\n    - PSA rise: If >4 or rapid rise, urology referral\n    - Sleep apnea worsening (should improve with weight loss)\n    - Cardiovascular: Data mixed, monitor symptoms\n\nSide Effects of TRT:\n\n18. Common:\n    - Acne\n    - Oily skin\n    - Injection site reactions (if IM)\n    - Mood changes\n\n19. Serious (monitor for):\n    - Polycythemia (elevated Hct)\n    - Worsening sleep apnea\n    - Prostate effects (monitor PSA)\n    - Cardiovascular (unclear risk, monitor)\n    - Testicular atrophy (expected)\n    - Infertility (expected while on TRT)\n\nErectile Dysfunction:\n\n20. May improve with TRT (libido often first to improve)\n21. If ED persists despite normalized testosterone:\n    - Consider PDE5 inhibitor: Sildenafil 50 mg PRN\n    - Often needed in addition to TRT\n\n22. Prescribe: Sildenafil 50 mg, take 1 hour before sexual activity PRN\n\nPrescriptions:\n\n23. Testosterone cypionate 200 mg/mL, inject 0.5 mL (100 mg) IM weekly\n24. Needles/syringes: 23G 1\" for injection, 18G for drawing\n25. Sildenafil 50 mg, take 1 tablet 1 hour before sexual activity PRN (#8, with refills)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n26. Return in 3 months:\n    - Assess symptom improvement (energy, libido, ED, mood)\n    - Review labs (testosterone trough, Hct, PSA)\n    - Adjust TRT dose if needed (target mid-normal testosterone)\n    - Weight and lifestyle progress\n\n27. MRI pituitary: Schedule and review results\n\nPatient Education:\n\n28. TRT replaces testosterone but requires monitoring\n29. Expect improvement in symptoms over weeks to months\n30. Libido and energy often improve first, body composition takes longer\n31. Lifestyle (weight loss, exercise) enhances TRT benefits\n32. Must monitor blood counts and prostate\n33.

Uses OTC acne products with minimal benefit.\n\nPast Medical History: Obesity\nMedications: None\nAllergies: NKDA\nFamily History: Mother has diabetes, grandmother had \"hormone problems\"\nSocial: Marketing specialist, non-smoker, occasional alcohol\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 124/82, HR 76, Weight 185 lbs, Height 5'4\", BMI 31.8\n\nGeneral: Overweight female, acne on face, visible facial hair\n\nSkin:\n- Acne: Inflammatory papules/pustules on face, back\n- Hirsutism: Terminal hair on chin, upper lip, chest (Ferriman-Gallwey score ~12, elevated)\n- Acanthosis nigricans: Present on posterior neck (insulin resistance sign)\n\nAbdomen: Obese, no masses\n\nPelvic exam: Normal external genitalia, no clitoromegaly\n\nLabs:\n- Total testosterone: 68 ng/dL (elevated, normal <45)\n- Free testosterone: Elevated\n- DHEA-S: 320 mcg/dL (upper normal)\n- 17-hydroxyprogesterone: 90 ng/dL (normal, rules out CAH)\n- LH: 12 mIU/mL\n- FSH: 4 mIU/mL\n- LH:FSH ratio: 3:1 (elevated, suggestive of PCOS)\n- Prolactin: 18 ng/mL (normal)\n- TSH: 2.3 mIU/L (normal)\n- Fasting glucose: 102 mg/dL (impaired fasting glucose)\n- Fasting insulin: 22 mIU/mL (elevated, insulin resistance)\n- HbA1c: 5.8% (prediabetes)\n- Lipid panel: TC 210, LDL 130, HDL 38 (low), TG 220 (elevated)\n\nPelvic Ultrasound:\n- Right ovary: 12 mL, >20 follicles (<10 mm each)\n- Left ovary: 10 mL, 18 follicles\n- Polycystic ovarian morphology present\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) (ICD-10: E28.2)\n\nRotterdam Criteria (2 of 3 required):\n1. Oligo/anovulation \u2713 (irregular periods)\n2. Hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical) \u2713 (hirsutism + elevated testosterone)\n3. Polycystic ovarian morphology \u2713 (ultrasound)\n\nOther causes ruled out:\n- Thyroid disease: TSH normal\n- Hyperprolactinemia: Prolactin normal\n- Congenital adrenal hyperplasia: 17-OHP normal\n- Androgen-secreting tumor: Testosterone not severely elevated\n\nAssociated Metabolic Features:\n- Prediabetes (HbA1c 5.8%, FG 102)\n- Insulin resistance (elevated insulin, acanthosis nigricans)\n- Dyslipidemia (high TG, low HDL)\n- Obesity (BMI 31.8)\n\n### Plan\nLifestyle Modification (First-Line):\n\n1. Weight loss:\n   - CRITICAL for PCOS management\n   - Even 5-10% weight loss can restore ovulation, improve metabolic parameters\n   - Goal: 10-20 lbs\n   - Calorie deficit 500 kcal/day\n\n2. Diet:\n   - Low glycemic index diet\n   - Reduce refined carbohydrates, sugars\n   - Increase fiber, protein, vegetables\n   - Nutritionist referral\n\n3. Exercise:\n   - 150 minutes/week moderate-intensity aerobic\n   - Resistance training 2-3 days/week\n   - Helps insulin sensitivity even without weight loss\n\nMenstrual Regulation (Prevents Endometrial Hyperplasia):\n\n4. Irregular periods lead to unopposed estrogen \u2192 endometrial hyperplasia risk\n5. Need regular withdrawal bleed at least every 3 months\n\n6. Oral contraceptive pill (OCP) - FIRST-LINE for menstrual regulation:\n   - Provides regular periods\n   - Reduces androgens (lowers testosterone, increases SHBG)\n   - Improves acne and hirsutism\n   - Prescribe: Low-dose OCP (ethinyl estradiol/drospirenone or norgestimate)\n\n7. Specific OCP: Drospirenone-containing (Yaz, Yasmin) - has anti-androgenic effect\n   - Or: Norgestimate-containing (Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Sprintec)\n   - Take daily, cyclic or continuous\n\n8. Alternative if OCP contraindicated:\n   - Progestin-only: Medroxyprogesterone 10 mg for 10-14 days every 1-3 months to induce withdrawal bleed\n   - Progestin IUD (Mirena) protects endometrium\n\nHirsutism Treatment:\n\n9. OCP will help (reduces androgens) - give 6 months to assess effect\n\n10. If OCP alone insufficient, add anti-androgen:\n    - Spironolactone 50-100 mg BID\n    - Anti-androgen, reduces hair growth\n    - MUST use contraception (teratogenic if pregnant)\n    - Monitor potassium (can cause hyperkalemia)\n    - Takes 6+ months to see improvement\n\n11. Prescribe: Spironolactone 50 mg BID (in addition to OCP)\n\n12. Topical: Eflornithine (Vaniqa) cream for facial hair\n    - Slows hair growth\n    - Apply to affected facial areas BID\n    - Takes 8 weeks to see effect\n\n13. Hair removal methods:\n    - Electrolysis or laser hair removal (for permanent reduction)\n    - Shaving, waxing, plucking (temporary)\n\nAcne Treatment:\n\n14. OCP will help acne (reduces androgens)\n15. Topical retinoid: Tretinoin or adapalene nightly\n16. Benzoyl peroxide wash or gel\n17. If severe: Consider doxycycline short-term, or spironolactone (already added)\n18. If refractory: Dermatology referral, consider isotretinoin\n\n19. Prescribe:\n    - Adapalene 0.1% gel, apply to face nightly\n    - Benzoyl peroxide 4% wash, use daily\n\nInsulin Resistance/Prediabetes:\n\n20. Metformin:\n    - Improves insulin sensitivity\n    - May help with weight loss, menstrual regulation\n    - Not FDA-approved for PCOS but commonly used\n    - Start: Metformin 500 mg with dinner, increase to 500 mg BID after 1 week\n    - Target: 1500-2000 mg/day\n\n21. Prescribe: Metformin 500 mg, take 1 with dinner x 1 week, then 1 BID\n\n22. Monitor: CMP at baseline and periodically (renal function)\n\nDyslipidemia:\n\n23. HDL low, TG high (typical PCOS pattern)\n24. Lifestyle first (weight loss, exercise, reduce carbs)\n25. Reassess lipids after 6 months of lifestyle + metformin\n26. May need statin if LDL remains elevated\n\nFuture Fertility Considerations:\n\n27. Patient not currently trying to conceive\n28. When ready:\n    - Stop OCP, spironolactone\n    - Ovulation induction: Letrozole (first-line) or clomiphene\n    - Weight loss improves ovulation rates\n    - Refer to REI (reproductive endocrinologist) if needed\n\n29. Counseled: PCOS can make conception more difficult but treatable\n\nLong-Term Risks (Counseling):\n\n30. Increased risk of:\n    - Type 2 diabetes (40% develop by age 40)\n    - Cardiovascular disease\n    - Endometrial hyperplasia/cancer (if not treated)\n    - Obstructive sleep apnea\n    - Depression/anxiety\n    - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\n\n31. Regular screening recommended:\n    - HbA1c every 1-3 years (or oral glucose tolerance test)\n    - Lipid panel every 1-2 years\n    - Blood pressure monitoring\n    - Depression screening\n\nMonitoring:\n\n32. Labs in 3-6 months:\n    - HbA1c, fasting glucose\n    - Lipid panel\n    - Potassium (on spironolactone)\n    - Testosterone (to assess anti-androgen effect)\n\n33. Assess:\n    - Menstrual regularity\n    - Hirsutism improvement (6-12 months)\n    - Acne improvement\n    - Weight loss progress\n\nPrescriptions:\n\n34. Drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol (Yaz, Loryna), 1 tab daily\n35. Spironolactone 50 mg, 1 tab BID\n36. Metformin 500 mg, start 1 with dinner, then 1 BID after 1 week\n37. Adapalene 0.1% gel, apply to face nightly\n38. Benzoyl peroxide 4% wash, use daily\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n39. Return in 3 months:\n    - Weight check\n    - Medication tolerance\n    - Menstrual pattern\n    - Labs: Potassium, renal function\n\n40. Nutritionist referral made\n\nPatient Education:\n\n41. PCOS is a lifelong condition but very manageable\n42. Weight loss is one of the most effective treatments\n43. Need to protect uterus with regular periods\n44. Treatment takes months to show full effect (especially hirsutism)\n45. Fertility is possible with treatment when ready"

        "output": "### Subjective\nPatient is a 45-year-old female with Type 2 diabetes presenting with recurrent hypoglycemic episodes. Reports:\n- Multiple low blood sugars over past month\n- Symptoms: Shakiness, sweating, confusion, hunger, palpitations\n- Blood glucose readings: 52, 48, 55, 61 mg/dL (multiple documented lows)\n- Episodes occur mostly before lunch and at night\n- Treated with juice, candy, crackers - symptoms resolve\n- One episode required husband's assistance (near loss of consciousness)\n- Afraid to exercise or skip meals now\n\nDiet: Eating less, trying to lose weight, sometimes skipping breakfast\n\nCurrent regimen:\n- Glipizide 10 mg BID (sulfonylurea)\n- Metformin 1000 mg BID\n- Started glipizide 3 months ago (dose increased 1 month ago from 5 mg to 10 mg BID)\n\nLast HbA1c: 6.1% (3 months ago) - may be too aggressive\n\nPast Medical History: Type 2 diabetes, obesity (BMI 32), hypertension\nMedications: As above, lisinopril 20 mg\nAllergies: NKDA\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 128/78, HR 76, Weight 175 lbs (lost 8 lbs in 3 months)\n\nGeneral: Anxious about blood sugars, otherwise well-appearing\n\nLabs:\n- HbA1c: 6.1% (likely overcorrected, recent hypoglycemia not fully reflected)\n- Fasting glucose today: 78 mg/dL (normal but on low end)\n- CMP: Normal, Cr 0.8\n- Glucometer download: Multiple readings <70, especially pre-lunch and 3 AM\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Recurrent Hypoglycemia Secondary to Sulfonylurea in Type 2 Diabetes (ICD-10: E16.0)\n\nCauses of Hypoglycemia in This Patient:\n1. Sulfonylurea (glipizide): Insulin secretagogue, high hypoglycemia risk\n2. Dose recently increased (10 mg BID is high dose)\n3. Weight loss (eating less, losing weight): Reduces insulin resistance\n4. Skipping meals: No food to match medication-induced insulin\n5. HbA1c 6.1%: Glycemic target may be too aggressive for this patient\n\nSeverity: Moderate-severe (one episode required assistance = Level 2-3 hypoglycemia)\n\n### Plan\nImmediate Medication Adjustment:\n\n1. REDUCE or DISCONTINUE sulfonylurea (glipizide)\n   - Primary cause of hypoglycemia\n   - High-risk medication, especially with weight loss, irregular eating\n\n2. Plan: Reduce glipizide from 10 mg BID to 5 mg BID\n   - OR discontinue entirely if continued hypoglycemia\n   - Patient has been losing weight, eating less - may not need glipizide\n\n3. Continue metformin 1000 mg BID:\n   - Does not cause hypoglycemia\n   - Safe to continue\n\n4. Prescribe: Glipizide 5 mg BID (reduced from 10 mg BID)\n\nAlternative Medication Considerations:\n\n5. If sulfonylurea discontinued, consider adding:\n   - SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin): Does not cause hypoglycemia, weight loss, CV benefit\n   - GLP-1 agonist (semaglutide, liraglutide): Does not cause hypoglycemia, weight loss\n   - DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin): Does not cause hypoglycemia\n\n6. These classes are preferred over sulfonylureas due to lower hypoglycemia risk\n\n7. Plan: If glipizide reduction not sufficient or A1c rises, add SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin 10 mg daily)\n\nGlycemic Goals:\n\n8. Current HbA1c 6.1% - too aggressive given recurrent hypoglycemia\n9. Revise target: HbA1c 7.0-7.5%\n10. Less stringent targets for patients with:\n    - Hypoglycemia risk\n    - Hypoglycemia unawareness\n    - Advanced age or comorbidities\n\n11. Quality of life matters - avoiding hypoglycemia is priority\n\nHypoglycemia Education (Rule of 15):\n\n12. Recognize symptoms: Shaking, sweating, confusion, hunger, palpitations, dizziness\n13. Check blood glucose if able (confirm <70 mg/dL)\n14. Treat with 15 grams fast-acting carbohydrate:\n    - 4 glucose tablets\n    - 4 oz (1/2 cup) juice or regular soda\n    - 1 tablespoon sugar or honey\n    - Glucose gel\n15. Wait 15 minutes, recheck glucose\n16. If still <70: Repeat treatment\n17. Once >70: Eat snack or meal to prevent recurrence\n\nPrescribe Glucagon:\n\n18. Glucagon emergency kit for severe hypoglycemia\n19. Options:\n    - Glucagon injection kit (Glucagon Emergency Kit)\n    - Nasal glucagon (Baqsimi) - easier for family to use\n    - Auto-injector (Gvoke HypoPen)\n\n20. Prescribe: Baqsimi (glucagon nasal powder) 3 mg, use for severe hypoglycemia when patient cannot eat\n\n21. Educate family/husband:\n    - When to use: Unconscious, seizure, unable to swallow\n    - How to administer nasal glucagon\n    - Call 911 after giving\n\nPreventing Hypoglycemia:\n\n22. Do not skip meals (especially on sulfonylurea)\n23. Regular meal timing\n24. Carry fast-acting sugar at all times (glucose tablets)\n25. Check blood glucose before driving and during exercise\n26. Bedtime snack if glucose <120 at bedtime\n27. Check blood glucose if symptoms occur\n\nExercise and Hypoglycemia:\n\n28. Exercise can lower blood glucose\n29. Check glucose before exercise\n30. If <100: Eat 15 g carbs before\n31. Have glucose tablets available during exercise\n32. May need to reduce glipizide on exercise days\n\nWeight Loss Adjustment:\n\n33. Patient losing weight (positive for diabetes)\n34. Weight loss reduces insulin resistance \u2192 less medication needed\n35. As weight decreases, may need to reduce diabetes medications\n36. Reassess medications with weight changes\n\nSelf-Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG):\n\n37. Continue checking blood glucose regularly\n38. Check: Fasting, pre-lunch, bedtime, any time symptomatic\n39. Log readings and bring to appointments\n40. Target: Fasting 80-130, pre-meal 80-130, post-meal <180\n\nHypoglycemia Unawareness Warning:\n\n41. If recurrent hypoglycemia continues, can develop hypoglycemia unawareness\n42. Loss of warning symptoms\n43. Increases risk of severe hypoglycemia\n44. Prevention: Avoid all hypoglycemia for several weeks to restore awareness\n\nMedical ID:\n\n45. Recommend medical alert bracelet or necklace\n46. States \"Diabetes\" in case of emergency\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n47. Return in 2 weeks:\n    - Review blood glucose log\n    - Assess for continued hypoglycemia\n    - May further reduce or discontinue glipizide\n    - Consider alternative medication\n\n48. Recheck HbA1c in 3 months\n\nWhen to Seek Care:\n\n49. Severe hypoglycemia (loss of consciousness, seizure)\n50. Hypoglycemia not responding to treatment\n51. Frequent hypoglycemia despite medication reduction\n52. Unable to keep food down (illness)\n\nPrescriptions Updated:\n\n53. Glipizide 5 mg BID (reduced from 10 mg BID)\n54. Metformin 1000 mg BID (no change)\n55. Baqsimi 3 mg nasal powder for emergency\n56. Glucose tablets: Keep available at all times\n\nPatient Education:\n\n57. Hypoglycemia is dangerous and preventable\n58. Reducing glipizide should help significantly\n59. Don't skip meals\n60. Carry glucose tablets everywhere\n61. Family should know how to use glucagon\n62. We'll adjust medications until blood sugars are safe and stable"

Starting treatment: Duloxetine (SNRI)\n   - FDA-approved for diabetic neuropathy\n   - Also helps if any depression/anxiety component\n   - Start: Duloxetine 30 mg daily x 1 week, then 60 mg daily\n   - Can increase to 60 mg BID if needed (max 120 mg/day)\n\n8. Alternative first-line: Pregabalin\n   - Start 75 mg BID, can increase to 150 mg BID\n   - Effective for neuropathic pain\n   - Side effects: Dizziness, drowsiness, weight gain\n\n9. If single agent insufficient:\n   - Combine duloxetine + gabapentin/pregabalin (different mechanisms)\n   - Or switch to different first-line agent\n\nGabapentin Option:\n\n10. If choosing gabapentin:\n    - Start 100-300 mg at bedtime\n    - Titrate: Increase by 100-300 mg every 3-7 days\n    - Target: 300-600 mg TID (or higher as tolerated)\n    - Adjust for renal function\n\n11. Side effects: Drowsiness, dizziness (start low, go slow)\n\nTopical Therapy (Adjunctive):\n\n12. Capsaicin cream 0.075%:\n    - Apply to painful areas TID-QID\n    - Burning sensation initially (depletes substance P)\n    - Takes 2-4 weeks for benefit\n    - Wash hands after application\n\n13. Lidocaine 5% patch:\n    - Apply to painful areas up to 12 hours daily\n    - Provides localized relief\n    - Few systemic side effects\n\n14. Prescribe: Lidocaine 5% patch, apply up to 3 patches to feet, 12 hours on/12 hours off\n\nSecond-Line Options (If First-Line Fails):\n\n15. Tricyclic antidepressants:\n    - Amitriptyline 10-25 mg at bedtime, titrate up\n    - Effective but more side effects (anticholinergic)\n    - Use with caution in elderly, cardiac disease\n\n16. Tramadol: Weak opioid + SNRI effect\n    - Use cautiously, abuse potential\n    - Reserved for refractory cases\n\n17. Strong opioids: Last resort, chronic pain clinic referral\n\n18. Tapentadol: Approved for neuropathic pain, alternative to tramadol\n\nNon-Pharmacologic:\n\n19. Foot care education (essential):\n    - Inspect feet daily (use mirror for soles)\n    - Check for cuts, blisters, redness, calluses\n    - Wash feet daily, dry thoroughly (especially between toes)\n    - Moisturize (but not between toes)\n    - Wear well-fitting shoes, avoid barefoot\n    - Trim toenails straight across\n\n20. Appropriate footwear:\n    - Supportive, well-fitting shoes\n    - May need diabetic shoes (Medicare may cover)\n    - Avoid flip-flops, high heels\n    - Check shoes for objects before wearing\n\n21. Podiatry referral for diabetic foot care\n\nFall Prevention:\n\n22. Sensory loss + neuropathy = fall risk\n23. Balance exercises\n24. Physical therapy referral\n25. Home safety evaluation\n26. Night lights (may not feel feet in dark)\n\nVitamin B12:\n\n27. Level 320 pg/mL (low-normal)\n28. Metformin can cause B12 deficiency\n29. Supplement: Vitamin B12 1000 mcg daily\n30. Recheck level in 6 months\n\nAlpha-Lipoic Acid:\n\n31. Antioxidant, some evidence for neuropathy\n32. May try: 600 mg daily\n33. Generally safe, modest benefit in some patients\n\nMonitoring:\n\n34. Pain scores: Track improvement with treatment\n35. Sleep quality: Neuropathic pain often disrupts sleep\n36. Function: Ability to work, walk, perform daily activities\n37. Side effects of medications\n\nPrescriptions:\n\n38. Duloxetine 30 mg, take 1 daily x 7 days, then 60 mg daily\n39. Lidocaine 5% patch, apply up to 3 patches to feet for 12 hours daily\n40. Vitamin B12 1000 mcg daily\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n41. Return in 4-6 weeks:\n    - Assess pain control\n    - Medication tolerance\n    - Adjust or add medications as needed\n    - Foot exam\n\n42. Podiatry referral: Diabetic foot care\n43. Consider pain management referral if refractory\n\nWarning Signs - Seek Immediate Care:\n\n44. Any foot wound, ulcer, or infection\n45. Change in foot color (red, pale, blue)\n46. Increased swelling\n47. Signs of infection (fever, drainage, warmth)\n48. New weakness or sudden change in sensation\n\nPatient Education:\n\n49. Diabetic neuropathy is common and treatable (pain, not numbness)\n50. Medications can significantly reduce pain\n51. Glucose control prevents worsening\n52. Foot care is critical - prevent ulcers and amputation\n53. Daily foot inspection is essential\n54. Report any cuts or changes to feet immediately"

Confirm hypercortisolism (biochemically)\n2. Determine etiology (ACTH-dependent vs ACTH-independent)\n3. Localize source\n\n### Plan\nConfirmatory Testing (Must Confirm Hypercortisolism):\n\n1. Order 3 tests (2 of 3 positive confirms Cushing's):\n   a) 24-hour urine free cortisol (UFC) x 2 collections\n   b) Late-night salivary cortisol x 2 nights\n   c) Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST)\n\n2. 24-hour urine free cortisol:\n   - Collect all urine for 24 hours\n   - Normal: Varies by lab, usually <50 mcg/24h\n   - Elevated in Cushing's (often >3x upper limit)\n   - Order 2 separate collections\n\n3. Late-night salivary cortisol:\n   - Collect saliva at 11 PM\n   - Normal: Should be low at night (nadir)\n   - Elevated in Cushing's (loss of diurnal rhythm)\n   - Order 2 samples on different nights\n\n4. Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (1 mg DST):\n   - Take dexamethasone 1 mg at 11 PM\n   - Measure serum cortisol at 8 AM next morning\n   - Normal: Cortisol suppresses to <1.8 mcg/dL\n   - No suppression = positive for Cushing's\n\n5. Prescribe: Dexamethasone 1 mg, take at 11 PM, come for cortisol draw at 8 AM\n\nDetermining Etiology (If Confirmed):\n\n6. Once hypercortisolism confirmed, measure ACTH:\n\nACTH-Dependent (ACTH elevated or normal):\n   - Cushing's disease (pituitary adenoma) - 70% of cases\n   - Ectopic ACTH (lung tumor, carcinoid) - 10%\n\nACTH-Independent (ACTH suppressed, <5 pg/mL):\n   - Adrenal adenoma\n   - Adrenal carcinoma\n   - Adrenal hyperplasia\n\n7. Order: Plasma ACTH (drawn at 8 AM, on ice)\n\nLocalization (Based on ACTH):\n\n8. If ACTH-dependent:\n   - MRI pituitary with and without contrast\n   - If pituitary normal or equivocal: Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS)\n   - Consider high-dose dexamethasone suppression test\n   - If ectopic suspected: CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, Octreotide scan\n\n9. If ACTH-independent:\n   - CT adrenals with and without contrast\n   - Adrenal adenoma vs carcinoma vs hyperplasia\n\n10. Plan: After confirming hypercortisolism, check ACTH, then imaging based on results\n\nManaging Complications While Working Up:\n\n11. Diabetes:\n    - Poorly controlled (A1c 9.2%)\n    - Cortisol causes insulin resistance\n    - May need to start insulin\n    - Add: Insulin glargine 10 units at bedtime, titrate\n\n12. Hypertension:\n    - Poorly controlled on 2 agents\n    - Cortisol has mineralocorticoid effect\n    - Add: Spironolactone 25 mg daily (also helps with hypokalemia)\n\n13. Hypokalemia:\n    - K+ 3.2 (low)\n    - Due to cortisol's mineralocorticoid activity\n    - Start: Potassium chloride 20 mEq BID\n    - Spironolactone also helps\n    - Recheck K+ in 1 week\n\n14. Bone health:\n    - Cortisol excess causes osteoporosis\n    - Order: DEXA scan (baseline)\n    - Start: Calcium 1000 mg + Vitamin D 2000 IU daily\n\n15. Infection risk:\n    - Cortisol is immunosuppressive\n    - Counsel on infection prevention\n    - Low threshold for evaluation if fevers or symptoms\n\n16. Psychiatric:\n    - Depression, cognitive issues common\n    - Monitor closely\n    - Consider psychiatry referral if worsening\n\n17. VTE risk: Increased in Cushing's - be aware\n\nReferrals:\n\n18. Endocrinology referral (if not already seeing): Urgent for Cushing's workup\n\n19. After etiology determined:\n    - Cushing's disease: Neurosurgery (transsphenoidal surgery)\n    - Adrenal tumor: Surgical oncology/adrenal surgery\n    - Ectopic ACTH: Oncology + surgery depending on source\n\nPatient Education:\n\n20. Cushing syndrome is excess cortisol from various causes\n21. Testing will determine the source\n22. Treatment depends on cause (usually surgery)\n23. Complications are reversible with treatment\n24. Process takes several weeks to fully work up\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n25. Return in 1-2 weeks with test results:\n    - 24-hour urine cortisol\n    - Salivary cortisol\n    - Dexamethasone suppression test result\n    - ACTH level\n\n26. Based on results: Schedule appropriate imaging\n\n27. Check:\n    - Potassium (after starting replacement)\n    - Blood glucose log (after starting insulin)\n    - Blood pressure log\n\nOrders:\n\n28. Labs:\n    - 24-hour urine free cortisol x 2\n    - Late-night salivary cortisol (kit provided) x 2 nights\n    - AM cortisol after 1 mg DST\n    - Plasma ACTH (8 AM, on ice)\n    - CMP with potassium\n    - DEXA scan\n\n29. Prescriptions:\n    - Dexamethasone 1 mg for suppression test\n    - Potassium chloride 20 mEq BID\n    - Spironolactone 25 mg daily\n    - Insulin glargine 10 units at bedtime\n    - Calcium 1000 mg + Vitamin D 2000 IU daily"

Nephrolithiasis \u2713 (calcium kidney stone)\n2. Osteoporosis at distal radius \u2713 (T-score -2.2)\n\nLikely Etiology: Single parathyroid adenoma (85% of cases)\n\n### Plan\nIndications for Surgery (Parathyroidectomy):\n\n1. Patient meets criteria for parathyroidectomy:\n   - Age <50 years \u2713\n   - Kidney stones \u2713 (indication alone)\n   - Osteoporosis (T-score \u2264-2.5 at any site by some guidelines; -2.2 at radius is concerning)\n   - 24-hour urine calcium >400 (patient at 380, borderline)\n\n2. Surgery is recommended (definitive treatment)\n\n3. Referral to experienced parathyroid surgeon\n\nPre-Operative Localization:\n\n4. Parathyroid sestamibi scan:\n   - Nuclear medicine imaging to localize adenoma\n   - Helps guide surgical approach\n\n5. Neck ultrasound:\n   - Identify parathyroid adenoma\n   - Also evaluate thyroid\n\n6. 4D-CT parathyroid: May be ordered by surgeon if other imaging inconclusive\n\n7. Localization studies help with minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP)\n\nSurgical Options:\n\n8. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP):\n   - If adenoma localized\n   - Smaller incision, shorter recovery\n   - Intraoperative PTH monitoring confirms cure (PTH drops >50%)\n\n9. Bilateral neck exploration:\n   - If localization negative or multigland disease suspected\n   - Examines all 4 parathyroid glands\n\n10. Cure rate: >95% in experienced hands\n\n11. Risks: Hypocalcemia (temporary or permanent), recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (hoarseness), bleeding, infection\n\nPre-Operative Management:\n\n12. Vitamin D deficiency:\n    - 25-OH vitamin D: 22 ng/mL (insufficient)\n    - Replete cautiously: Vitamin D3 1000-2000 IU daily\n    - Goal: 20-30 ng/mL pre-op (higher may worsen hypercalcemia)\n    - Low vitamin D can worsen hungry bone syndrome post-op\n\n13. Hydration:\n    - Maintain good hydration (at least 2L/day)\n    - Avoid dehydration (worsens hypercalcemia)\n\n14. Avoid:\n    - Thiazide diuretics (raise calcium)\n    - High calcium supplements\n    - Excessive dietary calcium\n    - Lithium (affects PTH)\n\n15. Monitor for symptoms of hypercalcemia:\n    - Stones, bones, groans, psychiatric overtones\n    - Seek care if: Severe nausea/vomiting, confusion, extreme weakness\n\nPost-Operative Care:\n\n16. Monitor for hypocalcemia (hungry bone syndrome):\n    - Especially if vitamin D deficient or osteoporosis\n    - Symptoms: Numbness/tingling (perioral, fingers), muscle cramps, tetany\n    - Check calcium 12-24 hours post-op\n\n17. Post-op calcium supplementation:\n    - Often given empirically: Calcium carbonate 500-1000 mg TID\n    - Active vitamin D (calcitriol) may be needed if severe hypocalcemia\n    - Taper as calcium stabilizes\n\n18. Confirm cure:\n    - PTH and calcium at 1 week and 1 month post-op\n    - Both should normalize\n\nIf Patient Declines or Cannot Have Surgery:\n\n19. Medical management options:\n    - Hydration\n    - Cinacalcet: Calcimimetic, lowers calcium (not PTH)\n    - Bisphosphonate: If osteoporosis\n    - Does not cure disease\n\n20. Monitoring if observation:\n    - Calcium and creatinine every 6-12 months\n    - DEXA every 1-2 years\n    - 24-hour urine calcium annually\n    - Renal imaging if symptoms\n\nKidney Stone Prevention:\n\n21. Hydration: 2.5+ liters fluid daily (goal urine output 2L/day)\n22. Low sodium diet (reduces urinary calcium)\n23. Normal dietary calcium (do not restrict - may worsen stones)\n24. Surgery should reduce stone recurrence by lowering calcium\n\nBone Health:\n\n25. Distal radius osteoporosis (T-score -2.2):\n    - Cortical bone preferentially affected in hyperparathyroidism\n    - Should improve after parathyroidectomy\n    - Repeat DEXA 1-2 years post-surgery\n\n26. Adequate vitamin D and calcium (careful pre-op)\n\n27. Weight-bearing exercise\n\nRule Out MEN Syndromes:\n\n28.

Timing: Give basal insulin 2-4 hours BEFORE stopping IV insulin drip\n   - Critical: Insulin drip must overlap with basal insulin\n   - Short-acting insulin (lispro) doesn't cover gap\n   - If drip stopped without basal overlap \u2192 rebound DKA risk\n\n2. Calculate 24-hour IV insulin requirement:\n   - Current drip rate: 2.5 units/hour\n   - 24-hour total: 2.5 x 24 = 60 units/day IV requirement\n\n3. Convert to subcutaneous insulin:\n   - Total daily dose (TDD) = 80% of IV requirement (to avoid hypoglycemia)\n   - TDD = 60 x 0.8 = 48 units/day\n   - OR use patient's prior home dose if appropriate and DKA precipitant addressed\n\n4. Patient's prior regimen: Glargine 22 units + ~20 units lispro/day = ~42 units TDD\n   - Prior regimen reasonable to restart with slight adjustment\n\n5. Subcutaneous insulin regimen (basal-bolus):\n   - Basal: Insulin glargine 24 units at bedtime (slightly increased from 22)\n   - Bolus: Insulin lispro per carb counting or correction scale\n   - Carb ratio: ~1 unit per 10-12 g carbs\n   - Correction factor: ~1 unit per 40 mg/dL above 150\n   - Or use prior doses with close follow-up\n\n6. Transition timing:\n   - Give glargine 24 units NOW (with lunch)\n   - Give lispro with lunch (per carb ratio/correction)\n   - Stop IV insulin drip 2 hours after glargine given\n   - Monitor glucose every 2-4 hours initially\n\nPre-Discharge Education:\n\n7. Sick day rules (CRITICAL - precipitant was missed insulin during illness):\n   - NEVER stop insulin, even when not eating\n   - Basal insulin must continue even if NPO or vomiting\n   - May need to adjust rapid-acting insulin\n   - Check blood glucose every 2-4 hours when sick\n   - Check ketones if glucose >250 or feeling unwell\n\n8. When to call or go to ER:\n   - Blood glucose >300 that doesn't come down\n   - Ketones positive (moderate/large)\n   - Vomiting and unable to keep fluids/medications down\n   - Symptoms of DKA: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, rapid breathing\n\n9. Hydration during illness:\n   - Drink fluids frequently\n   - If not eating: Clear liquids with electrolytes\n   - Dehydration worsens DKA\n\n10. Have glucagon kit for severe hypoglycemia\n\n11. Ketone monitoring:\n    - Prescribe: Blood ketone meter and strips\n    - Check ketones when: Glucose >250, illness, nausea/vomiting\n    - Urine ketone strips alternative (less accurate)\n\nGlycemic Management Post-Discharge:\n\n12. Blood glucose monitoring:\n    - Check at least 4 times daily: Fasting, before meals, bedtime\n    - More frequently when sick or adjusting doses\n\n13. Consider CGM (continuous glucose monitor):\n    - Dexcom G6/G7 or Freestyle Libre 2/3\n    - Helps identify patterns, alerts for lows/highs\n    - Discuss with endocrinologist\n\n14. Insulin pump consideration:\n    - May help with glucose control and flexibility\n    - Requires training and commitment\n    - Discuss at endocrinology follow-up\n\n15. HbA1c 8.9%: Target <7%\n    - Optimize regimen with endocrinology\n    - Carb counting education if not proficient\n\nDischarge Medications:\n\n16. Insulin glargine 24 units SQ at bedtime (adjust based on follow-up)\n17. Insulin lispro: Use carb ratio 1:10 and correction 1:40 over 150\n    - Approximately 6-10 units per meal depending on meal size\n18. Continue levothyroxine 75 mcg daily\n19. Blood ketone meter with test strips\n20. Glucagon emergency kit (Baqsimi nasal or Gvoke)\n\nSupplies:\n\n21. Glucometer, test strips, lancets (ensure adequate supply)\n22. Insulin syringes or pen needles\n23. Ketone strips\n24. Sharps container\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n25. Endocrinology appointment: Within 1-2 weeks\n    - Review glucose logs\n    - Adjust insulin doses\n    - Discuss CGM and pump options\n    - Recheck A1c in 3 months\n\n26. PCP follow-up: Within 1 week\n    - General post-hospitalization check\n    - Ensure no illness recurrence\n\n27. If any DKA warning signs: Return to ER immediately\n\nDischarge Criteria Met:\n\n28. DKA resolved \u2713\n29. Eating, drinking \u2713\n30. Transitioned to SQ insulin \u2713\n31. Stable blood sugars \u2713\n32. Sick day education provided \u2713\n33. Follow-up arranged \u2713\n34. Prescriptions and supplies in hand \u2713\n\nDischarge Instructions Reviewed:\n\n35. Take insulin as prescribed - never stop\n36. Check blood sugar at least 4 times daily\n37. Sick day rules reviewed and written instructions provided\n38. Follow up with endocrinology in 1-2 weeks\n39. Return if: Persistent vomiting, glucose >300, ketones positive, symptoms of DKA"

Home BP Monitoring:\n   - Continue checking BP at home\n   - Check morning and evening, record in log\n   - Bring log to next visit\n\n4. Lifestyle for BP:\n   - DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)\n   - Reduce sodium intake (<2300 mg/day, ideally <1500 mg)\n   - Weight loss\n   - Regular exercise\n   - Limit alcohol (not drinking currently - good)\n\n5. Recheck BP in 4 weeks after dose increase\n\nDiabetes Management:\n\n6. Add Second Diabetes Medication:\n   - A1c 8.5% on metformin 2000 mg - need additional agent\n   - Recommended: SGLT-2 Inhibitor (empagliflozin or dapagliflozin)\n     - Benefits: CV protection, renal protection, weight loss, BP lowering\n     - Especially indicated with microalbuminuria/CKD\n   - Start: Empagliflozin (Jardiance) 10 mg daily, may increase to 25 mg\n   - OR Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) 10 mg daily\n\n7. Alternative Second Agents:\n   - GLP-1 agonist (semaglutide, liraglutide): Excellent for weight loss, CV benefit\n   - Consider if cost/insurance allows\n   - Semaglutide (Ozempic) 0.25 mg weekly \u2192 titrate up\n\n8. Continue Metformin 1000 mg BID (tolerated, eGFR >45)\n\n9. Counseling:\n   - Empagliflozin side effects: Genital yeast infections, UTI, volume depletion\n   - Stay hydrated\n   - Monitor for signs of ketoacidosis (rare)\n\n10.

A1c Recheck:\n    - Recheck HbA1c in 3 months\n    - Goal: <7%\n\nDiabetic Kidney Disease:\n\n13. Microalbuminuria Detected (UACR 45):\n    - Early diabetic nephropathy\n    - ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) is renoprotective - continue and increase\n    - SGLT-2 inhibitor has additional renal protection - starting above\n    - Tight BP control (<130/80) slows progression\n    - Tight glucose control slows progression\n\n14. Monitor Kidney Function:\n    - Recheck creatinine, potassium in 2 weeks after lisinopril increase\n    - Annual UACR to track progression\n\nDiabetes Complications Screening:\n\n15. Eye Exam:\n    - Overdue (last exam 2 years ago)\n    - Refer to ophthalmology for dilated retinal exam\n    - Annual screening required\n\n16. Foot Exam:\n    - Today: Monofilament normal, no ulcers \u2713\n    - Annual comprehensive foot exam\n    - Daily self-inspection of feet\n    - Proper footwear\n\n17. Cardiovascular Risk:\n    - High CV risk (DM + HTN + family history)\n    - Already on statin \u2713\n    - Adding SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA provides CV protection\n    - Aspirin: Not routinely recommended for primary prevention (discuss risk/benefit)\n\nHyperlipidemia:\n\n18. LDL 102 on atorvastatin 20 mg\n    - Goal for diabetic: LDL <70-100 mg/dL (or <70 if high risk)\n    - Consider increasing atorvastatin to 40 mg for better CV protection\n    - Defer until BP and glucose addressed\n\nWeight Management:\n\n19. BMI 34 - Weight loss critical:\n    - 5-10% weight loss improves BP, glucose, and lipids\n    - Goal: Lose 10-20 lbs over next 6 months\n    - Caloric deficit, physical activity\n    - SGLT-2 inhibitor and GLP-1 RA both help with weight loss\n\n20. Exercise:\n    - Currently sedentary - needs to start\n    - Goal: 150 minutes/week moderate activity (walking, swimming)\n    - Start with 10-15 minutes daily, gradually increase\n    - Benefits: Improves insulin sensitivity, BP, weight\n\n21. Consider Weight Loss Program:\n    - Diabetes Prevention Program type intervention\n    - Medically supervised weight loss if interested\n    - Bariatric surgery option if BMI >40 or >35 with comorbidities\n\nMedication Summary:\n\n22.

First-Line: SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor)\n   - Start: Sertraline (Zoloft) 25 mg daily for 1 week, then increase to 50 mg daily\n   - OR Escitalopram (Lexapro) 5 mg daily for 1 week, then increase to 10 mg daily\n   - Both are first-line for GAD\n\n2. Prescription: Sertraline 25 mg #30\n   - Take 25 mg daily for first week\n   - Increase to 50 mg daily starting week 2 (prescribe additional 50 mg tablets)\n   - Take in the morning (can cause insomnia in some)\n\n3. Counseling on SSRI:\n   - Takes 2-4 weeks to see benefit (be patient)\n   - May feel worse initially (increased anxiety) - transient\n   - Common side effects: Nausea (take with food), headache, insomnia, sexual dysfunction\n   - Side effects often improve over 1-2 weeks\n   - Do NOT stop abruptly (taper when discontinuing)\n   - No alcohol interaction specifically, but alcohol worsens anxiety\n\n4. Benzodiazepines:\n   - NOT first-line for GAD (dependence, tolerance)\n   - May consider short-term PRN (2-4 weeks) if severe symptoms while waiting for SSRI to work\n   - If used: Lorazepam 0.5 mg PRN (max 2-3x/week), limited supply\n   - In this patient: Avoid given at-risk alcohol use - risk of cross-dependence\n   - Will NOT prescribe benzos for this patient\n\n5. Alternative Medications (if SSRI fails or not tolerated):\n   - SNRI (duloxetine, venlafaxine)\n   - Buspirone (non-addictive, takes 2-4 weeks)\n   - Gabapentin (off-label)\n   - Hydroxyzine (PRN)\n\nPsychotherapy:\n\n6. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):\n   - First-line treatment for GAD (equal to medication)\n   - Can be combined with medication for best outcomes\n   - Refer to therapist trained in CBT\n   - Typical course: 12-16 sessions\n\n7. Referral: Therapist/psychologist for CBT\n   - Provide referral list or help coordinate\n   - Can start while medication takes effect\n\n8. Elements of CBT for GAD:\n   - Identify automatic negative thoughts\n   - Challenge cognitive distortions\n   - Behavioral experiments\n   - Relaxation training\n   - Exposure to worry triggers\n\nLifestyle Modifications:\n\n9. Sleep Hygiene:\n   - Consistent sleep schedule\n   - Avoid screens 1 hour before bed\n   - Relaxation techniques at bedtime\n   - Limit caffeine, especially after noon\n   - Cool, dark, quiet room\n\n10. Exercise:\n    - Regular aerobic exercise reduces anxiety\n    - Goal: 30 minutes, 5 days/week\n    - Walking, jogging, swimming - whatever patient enjoys\n    - Can be as effective as medication for mild-moderate anxiety\n\n11. Caffeine:\n    - Reduce or eliminate caffeine (worsens anxiety)\n    - Assess intake - gradually reduce if high\n\n12. Alcohol:\n    - Counsel on alcohol and anxiety:\n    - Alcohol initially sedates but WORSENS anxiety (rebound anxiety)\n    - Using alcohol to cope is concerning pattern\n    - Goal: Eliminate or minimize alcohol use\n    - If cannot cut back, may need alcohol treatment support\n\n13. Relaxation Techniques:\n    - Deep breathing exercises (4-7-8 technique)\n    - Progressive muscle relaxation\n    - Mindfulness meditation (apps: Calm, Headspace)\n    - Practice daily - becomes more effective with time\n\n14. Stress Reduction:\n    - Identify and reduce stressors where possible\n    - Time management\n    - Boundaries at work\n    - Social support - talk to spouse about stress\n\nRule Out Medical Causes:\n\n15. Order Labs:\n    - TSH (rule out hyperthyroidism)\n    - CBC, CMP (general health screen)\n    - Consider if symptoms atypical or treatment-resistant\n\nSafety:\n\n16. Safety Assessment:\n    - No suicidal ideation today \u2713\n    - No homicidal ideation \u2713\n    - Safety plan: If develops suicidal thoughts, go to ER, call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)\n    - Monitor mood on SSRI (rare activation/worsening in first weeks)\n\n17. Educate on Warning Signs:\n    - New or worsening depression\n    - Suicidal thoughts (call immediately)\n    - Unusual behavior changes\n    - Family should be aware\n\nPatient Education:\n\n18. GAD Explained:\n    - GAD is a real, treatable medical condition\n    - Not a character flaw or weakness\n    - Combination of genetics, brain chemistry, life experiences\n    - Very treatable with medication and therapy\n\n19. Resources:\n    - Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA)\n    - Self-help books: \"The Worry Cure\" by Robert Leahy\n    - Apps: Calm, Headspace, Woebot\n\nFollow-up:\n\n20. Follow-up Appointment in 2-4 weeks:\n    - Assess medication tolerance\n    - Evaluate symptom response\n    - Adjust dose if needed\n    - If no response at 50 mg after 4-6 weeks, can increase to 75-100 mg\n\n21. Therapy:\n    - Schedule first therapy appointment within 2 weeks\n    - CBT + medication is gold standard\n\n22. Long-Term:\n    - If good response, continue medication for 12+ months\n    - Reduces relapse risk\n    - Taper slowly when discontinuing\n\n23. Phone Check-In:\n    - Call in 1 week to check on tolerating medication\n    - Any concerns, call sooner\n\n24. PRN Contact:\n    - If worsening anxiety, panic, depression - call\n    - If suicidal thoughts - call 988 or go to ER\n    - After hours: Use crisis line or ER\n\nGoals:\n- Reduce anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 <5)\n- Improve sleep\n- Improve work and relationship function\n- Eliminate alcohol as coping\n- Develop healthy coping strategies"

Dehydration (decreased intake + diarrhea + hot weather)\n2. Overmedication for blood pressure (3 antihypertensives)\n3. Tamsulosin (alpha-blocker - causes orthostatic hypotension)\n4. Age-related autonomic changes\n5. CKD (reduced ability to concentrate urine)\n6. HCTZ (diuretic causing volume depletion)\n\nSecondary Diagnosis:\n- Acute Kidney Injury (prerenal) - Cr 1.8 from 1.5\n- Volume Depletion (ICD-10: E86.1)\n\n### Plan\nImmediate Management:\n\n1. Oral Hydration:\n   - Encourage fluids: 2-3 liters per day\n   - Electrolyte-containing fluids (Gatorade, Pedialyte) if tolerated\n   - If unable to tolerate oral fluids: Consider IV fluids\n\n2. If Severely Symptomatic/Dehydrated:\n   - IV Normal Saline 500-1000 mL in office or urgent care\n   - Then transition to oral hydration\n\nMedication Adjustments:\n\n3. STOP Hydrochlorothiazide:\n   - Diuretic contributing to volume depletion\n   - Already dehydrated - diuretic is counterproductive\n   - Can restart later if needed once hydrated\n\n4. HOLD or REDUCE Lisinopril:\n   - Current: 20 mg daily\n   - Reduce to: 10 mg daily (or hold if BP low)\n   - ACE inhibitor worsens AKI in dehydration\n   - Resume/increase once kidney function and volume restored\n\n5. CONTINUE Amlodipine 10 mg (may reduce to 5 mg if BP remains low):\n   - Less likely to cause orthostasis than others\n   - Adjust based on BP readings\n\n6. Tamsulosin:\n   - Review necessity - contributes to orthostatic hypotension\n   - Continue for now if BPH symptoms require it\n   - Take at bedtime to minimize daytime orthostatic effects\n   - Consider alternative: 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (finasteride) less orthostasis\n\nSummary of Medication Changes:\n| Medication | Current | Change |\n|------------|---------|--------|\n| Lisinopril 20 mg | Daily | Reduce to 10 mg daily |\n| Amlodipine 10 mg | Daily | Continue (may reduce later) |\n| HCTZ 25 mg | Daily | STOP |\n| Tamsulosin 0.4 mg | Daily | Continue (take at bedtime) |\n| Metformin 500 mg | BID | HOLD if Cr >1.5 (hold for now) |\n\n7. Hold Metformin:\n   - Creatinine 1.8 (above threshold)\n   - Risk of lactic acidosis in AKI\n   - Resume when Cr returns to baseline (<1.5)\n\nNon-Pharmacological Measures:\n\n8. Orthostatic Precautions:\n   - Rise slowly from lying to sitting, sit for 1-2 minutes\n   - Then sit to standing slowly, hold onto something\n   - Avoid sudden position changes\n   - Dangle legs at bedside before standing in morning\n\n9. Dorsiflexion Exercises:\n   - Before standing, pump ankles up and down (10 times)\n   - Increases venous return\n\n10. Avoid Triggers:\n    - Avoid prolonged standing\n    - Avoid hot environments (vasodilation)\n    - Avoid large meals (postprandial hypotension)\n    - Avoid alcohol\n\n11. Compression Stockings:\n    - Waist-high or thigh-high preferred (knee-high less effective)\n    - 15-20 mmHg or 20-30 mmHg\n    - Put on before getting out of bed\n    - Improves venous return, reduces orthostasis\n\n12. Increase Dietary Salt (if tolerated):\n    - Liberalize sodium intake temporarily\n    - Helps retain fluid\n    - Caution if heart failure (not present in this patient)\n\n13. Sleep Position:\n    - Elevate head of bed 10-20 degrees\n    - Reduces supine hypertension and helps with morning orthostasis\n\nMonitoring:\n\n14. Home Blood Pressure Monitoring:\n    - Check BP lying down and standing daily\n    - Record and bring to follow-up\n    - Goal: Prevent falls while maintaining reasonable BP control\n\n15. Labs Recheck:\n    - Recheck BMP (Cr, K) in 3-5 days\n    - Ensure AKI is resolving with hydration\n    - Resume metformin when Cr returns to baseline\n\n16. Fall Prevention:\n    - High fall risk with orthostatic hypotension\n    - Home safety: Remove throw rugs, adequate lighting, grab bars\n    - Use cane or walker if unsteady\n    - Do not drive until symptoms resolve\n\nPharmacological Treatment for Orthostatic Hypotension (If Persistent):\n\n17. If non-pharmacological measures fail:\n    - Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily (volume expansion)\n      - Caution: Causes hypokalemia, supine hypertension, edema\n    - Midodrine 2.5-10 mg TID (alpha-agonist, raises BP)\n      - Do not take after 6 PM (supine hypertension at night)\n      - Caution: Urinary retention (already has BPH)\n    - Pyridostigmine (off-label)\n    - Droxidopa (for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension)\n\n18. For this patient: Try non-pharmacological measures first\n\nAcute Kidney Injury:\n\n19. Prerenal AKI due to dehydration\n20. Management:\n    - Volume repletion (oral or IV fluids)\n    - Hold nephrotoxic medications (none currently)\n    - Hold metformin until Cr improves\n    - Recheck creatinine in 3-5 days\n    - Should improve with hydration\n\nBlood Pressure Goals:\n\n21. Reassess BP goals in elderly patient:\n    - Less aggressive targets may be appropriate\n    - Standing SBP should be at least 100-110 mmHg to prevent symptoms\n    - Avoid overtreatment\n    - Guideline: SBP <140-150 often acceptable in elderly\n\n22. Previously on 3 antihypertensives - likely overmedicated\n    - Now on 2 (stopped HCTZ, reduced lisinopril)\n    - Reassess BP control once hydrated\n\nFollow-up:\n\n23. Phone call in 2-3 days:\n    - How is fluid intake?\n    - Still having dizziness?\n    - Any falls?\n    - Home BP readings?\n\n24. Office visit in 1 week:\n    - Orthostatic vital signs\n    - Review labs (Cr, K)\n    - Adjust medications as needed\n    - Ensure AKI resolved\n\n25. Return Sooner If:\n    - Fall or injury\n    - Syncope (loss of consciousness)\n    - Severe dizziness not improving\n    - Unable to tolerate fluids\n    - Signs of worsening (confusion, weakness, chest pain)\n\nPatient Education:\n\n26. Explained:\n    - Orthostatic hypotension = BP drops when standing\n    - Causes dizziness and falls\n    - Caused by dehydration + blood pressure medications\n    - Treatable with fluids and medication adjustment\n\n27. Warned about fall risk - be careful standing, use assistance\n\n28. Do not stop BP medications on own - follow plan discussed\n\nSummary:\n- Diagnosis: Orthostatic hypotension (dehydration + medication-induced)\n- Interventions: Hydration, stop HCTZ, reduce lisinopril, hold metformin\n- Precautions: Rise slowly, compression stockings, fall prevention\n- Follow-up: Labs in 3-5 days, visit in 1 week"

Describes substernal pressure/tightness, 6/10 severity, occurring with exertion (walking uphill, climbing stairs, carrying groceries). Pain radiates to left arm. Associated with mild shortness of breath. Relieved by rest within 5 minutes. No pain at rest currently. No nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis with episodes. Episodes last 3-5 minutes. Occurring 3-4 times per week, predictable with exertion. No recent change in frequency or intensity.\n\nCardiac Risk Factors:\n- Hypertension x 15 years\n- Hyperlipidemia x 10 years\n- Type 2 diabetes x 8 years\n- Smoking: Quit 5 years ago (30 pack-years)\n- Family history: Father MI at 55, brother stent at 52\n- Sedentary lifestyle\n\nPast Medical History:\n- HTN, DM2, HLD\n- No prior cardiac history\n- No prior stress test or catheterization\n\nMedications:\n- Lisinopril 20 mg daily\n- Metformin 1000 mg BID\n- Atorvastatin 40 mg daily\n- Aspirin 81 mg daily\n\nAllergies: NKDA\nSocial: Retired, former smoker, no alcohol\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- BP: 142/88 mmHg\n- HR: 78 bpm\n- RR: 16\n- SpO2: 98% on RA\n- Weight: 220 lbs, BMI: 31\n\nGeneral: Alert, comfortable, no acute distress (currently pain-free)\n\nCardiovascular:\n- Regular rate and rhythm\n- S1, S2 normal, no S3/S4\n- No murmurs\n- JVP not elevated\n- Peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally\n- No peripheral edema\n\nPulmonary: Clear to auscultation\n\nAbdomen: Soft, obese, non-tender\n\nECG (done today): Normal sinus rhythm, no ST changes, no Q waves, no ischemic changes at rest\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Typical Angina Pectoris - Probable Stable Angina (ICD-10: I20.9)\n\nAngina Classification:\n- Substernal chest discomfort\n- Provoked by exertion\n- Relieved by rest\n- All 3 criteria = TYPICAL ANGINA\n\nPre-Test Probability of CAD: HIGH\n- Male, age 62\n- Typical angina symptoms\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (HTN, DM, HLD, smoking history, strong FHx)\n\nRisk Stratification: Intermediate-high risk - needs evaluation\n\n### Plan\nImmediate Management:\n\n1. Start antianginal therapy:\n   - Aspirin 81 mg daily - CONTINUE\n   - Atorvastatin: Increase to 80 mg daily (high-intensity statin)\n   - ADD: Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL PRN for chest pain (carry at all times)\n   - ADD: Metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily (beta-blocker for angina)\n\n2. Nitroglycerin instructions:\n   - Take 1 tablet under tongue at onset of chest pain\n   - May repeat every 5 minutes x 3 doses\n   - If pain persists after 3 doses: CALL 911\n   - Sit down before taking (can cause hypotension)\n   - Store in original container, check expiration\n\nCardiac Workup:\n\n3. Labs:\n   - Troponin (today) - rule out acute event\n   - BNP\n   - Lipid panel\n   - HbA1c\n   - BMP\n   - CBC\n\n4. Stress Testing (URGENT - within 1-2 weeks):\n   - Exercise stress test with imaging (stress echo or nuclear)\n   - If unable to exercise: Pharmacologic stress (adenosine, regadenoson, dobutamine)\n   - Will reveal if ischemia present and extent\n\n5. If positive stress test:\n   - Cardiology referral\n   - Likely coronary angiography\n   - Discussion of revascularization (PCI vs CABG)\n\n6. Cardiology referral: Urgent if symptoms worsen, otherwise after stress test\n\nRisk Factor Optimization:\n\n7. Blood pressure: 142/88 - not at goal\n   - Start metoprolol (above) - helps BP and angina\n   - Goal BP: <130/80\n   - May need to increase lisinopril if not at goal\n\n8. Diabetes: A1c likely elevated\n   - Goal A1c <7%\n   - Continue metformin, add medication if needed\n   - Consider SGLT2 inhibitor (cardiovascular benefit)\n\n9. Lipids: Increase statin to high-intensity\n   - Goal LDL <70 mg/dL (with CAD)\n   - Consider adding ezetimibe if not at goal\n\n10. Smoking: Quit 5 years - excellent, continue abstinence\n\n11. Weight: BMI 31 - discuss weight loss\n    - Goal: Lose 10% body weight\n    - Cardiac rehab can help after workup complete\n\nActivity Precautions:\n\n12. Avoid strenuous exertion that triggers symptoms until workup complete\n13. Light activity okay\n14. Use nitroglycerin if chest pain occurs\n15. Call 911 if chest pain at rest, prolonged, or severe\n\nRed Flags - Go to ER Immediately:\n\n16. Chest pain at rest lasting >20 minutes\n17. Chest pain not relieved by nitroglycerin\n18. Chest pain with diaphoresis, nausea, severe SOB\n19. Chest pain with syncope\n20. Any change in pattern (more frequent, more severe, longer lasting = unstable angina)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n21. Stress test scheduled within 1-2 weeks\n22. Call with results\n23. If positive: Cardiology referral for angiography\n24. Return visit in 2-4 weeks to review results and optimize medications\n25. Call or ER if worsening symptoms\n\nPatient Education:\n\n26. Symptoms are consistent with angina (reduced blood flow to heart)\n27. Need to determine if blockages present\n28. Treatable with medications, stents, or surgery depending on findings\n29. Importance of risk factor control\n30. Carry nitroglycerin at all times"

Goal: Reassociate bed with sleep, not frustration\n\nSleep Restriction (Powerful Technique):\n\n18. Limit time in bed to actual sleep time initially\n    - Currently sleeping ~5 hours, spending 8 hours in bed\n    - Restrict to 6 hours in bed initially (e.g., 12 AM - 6 AM)\n19. Creates sleep pressure, improves efficiency\n20. Gradually extend as efficiency improves (>85%)\n21. Formal sleep restriction best done with CBT-I therapist\n\nRelaxation Techniques:\n\n22. Progressive muscle relaxation\n23. Deep breathing exercises (4-7-8 technique)\n24. Mindfulness/meditation apps (Calm, Headspace)\n25. Practice in evening, not just when trying to sleep\n\nAddress Anxiety:\n\n26. GAD-7: 10 - moderate anxiety\n27. Stress management strategies\n28. Consider counseling for work stress\n29. If anxiety significant: May consider SSRI (would help both anxiety and sleep)\n30. Current plan: Start with CBT-I, reassess anxiety\n\nMedications (Second-Line, If CBT-I Insufficient):\n\n31. Not starting sleep medication initially\n32. If needed later, options:\n    - Melatonin 3-5 mg 1 hour before bed (OTC, minimal side effects)\n    - Trazodone 25-50 mg at bedtime (off-label, sedating antidepressant)\n    - Low-dose doxepin 3-6 mg (Silenor)\n    - Avoid benzodiazepines and Z-drugs long-term (dependence, rebound insomnia)\n33. Discuss risks/benefits if not improving with CBT-I\n\nSleep Diary:\n\n34. Keep sleep diary for 2 weeks:\n    - Bedtime, sleep latency, wake times, total sleep\n    - Caffeine, alcohol, medications\n    - How rested felt in morning (1-10)\n35. Bring to follow-up\n\nWork-up (Not Indicated Currently):\n\n36. Sleep study (polysomnography): Not needed unless symptoms of sleep apnea, restless legs, or no response to treatment\n37. Labs: Consider TSH if other symptoms of thyroid disorder\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n38. Return in 4-6 weeks to assess:\n    - Sleep diary review\n    - Response to sleep hygiene/behavioral changes\n    - CBT-I progress\n    - Anxiety\n39. Consider medication if not improving with behavioral therapy\n\nPatient Education:\n\n40. Insomnia is treatable\n41. CBT-I is more effective long-term than sleeping pills\n42. Takes time and consistency - not overnight fix\n43. Medication is option but not first choice for chronic insomnia\n44. Addressing stress/anxiety will help sleep"

        "output": "### Subjective\nPatient is a 22-year-old female presenting with acne for 3 years. Currently moderate severity with mix of comedones and inflammatory papules/pustules. Located on face (cheeks, chin, forehead) and some on upper back. Has tried OTC products (benzoyl peroxide wash, salicylic acid) with minimal improvement. Breakouts worse around menstrual period. Occasional scarring from picking. Affecting self-esteem and confidence. No current prescription treatments. Not currently pregnant, sexually active, uses oral contraceptives.\n\nSkin Care Routine:\n- Cleanser: Salicylic acid wash\n- Moisturizer: Yes, oil-free\n- Sunscreen: Sometimes\n- Makeup: Daily, removes at night\n\nPast Medical History: None\nMedications: Oral contraceptive (Sprintec) x 2 years\nAllergies: NKDA\nSocial: College student, non-smoker, social alcohol\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 118/72, Weight 135 lbs\n\nSkin Examination:\n- Face:\n  - Distribution: Bilateral cheeks, chin, forehead\n  - Comedones: Multiple open and closed comedones\n  - Papules: 15-20 inflammatory papules\n  - Pustules: 8-10 pustules\n  - Nodules/cysts: None (no severe/nodulocystic acne)\n  - Scarring: Few shallow atrophic scars on cheeks\n  - Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation: Present\n- Upper back: Scattered comedones and few papules\n- Chest: Clear\n\nAcne Grade: Moderate inflammatory acne\n\nHirsutism: None\nSigns of hyperandrogenism: None\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Acne Vulgaris, Moderate (ICD-10: L70.0)\n\n- Moderate inflammatory acne with comedonal component\n- Failed OTC benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid alone\n- No nodules/cysts (not severe)\n- Some post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and early scarring\n- Menstrual flares suggest hormonal component\n\n### Plan\nTopical Therapy (First-Line for Moderate Acne):\n\n1. Combination topical therapy - more effective than single agents:\n   - Adapalene 0.1%/Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel (Epiduo) - apply to face nightly\n   - OR Tretinoin 0.025% cream nightly + Benzoyl peroxide 5% gel in morning\n\n2. Prescribed: Adapalene 0.1% gel (Differin) - apply to entire face nightly\n   - Start every other night for 2 weeks, then nightly\n   - Retinoid = first-line for comedonal and inflammatory acne\n   - Prevents new lesions, treats existing\n   - Expect purging first 2-4 weeks (temporary worsening)\n\n3. Benzoyl peroxide 5% gel - apply in morning\n   - Antibacterial, reduces P. acnes\n   - Can bleach fabrics (use white towels/pillowcases)\n\n4. If not responding in 8-12 weeks, add:\n   - Topical antibiotic: Clindamycin 1% gel (use with benzoyl peroxide to prevent resistance)\n   - Available as combination: Clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel (Duac, BenzaClin)\n\nOral Therapy (If Moderate-Severe or Topicals Fail):\n\n5. Not starting oral antibiotics today - try topicals first\n6. If inadequate response at 12 weeks, consider:\n   - Doxycycline 100 mg daily (or 50 mg BID) x 3 months\n   - Limit duration to 3-4 months to minimize resistance\n\nHormonal Therapy:\n\n7. Already on oral contraceptive (Sprintec) - helps acne\n8. If hormonal component prominent:\n   - Could switch to OCP with higher anti-androgen effect (e.g., Yaz, Ortho Tri-Cyclen)\n   - Spironolactone 50-100 mg daily: Anti-androgen, effective for hormonal acne\n   - Consider if ongoing menstrual flares\n\nSkin Care Recommendations:\n\n9. Gentle cleanser: Cetaphil, CeraVe, La Roche-Posay (non-comedogenic)\n10. Moisturizer: Oil-free, non-comedogenic (CeraVe PM, Neutrogena Hydro Boost)\n11. Sunscreen: Daily SPF 30+ (retinoids increase sun sensitivity, also helps hyperpigmentation)\n12. Makeup: Non-comedogenic, remove every night\n13. Avoid picking: Worsens scarring and hyperpigmentation\n\nPost-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation:\n\n14. Will improve with acne treatment and sun protection\n15. Retinoids help fade hyperpigmentation\n16. Additional options later: Azelaic acid 15-20%, vitamin C serum, chemical peels\n\nRetinoid Instructions:\n\n17. Apply pea-sized amount to entire face, not just spots\n18. Avoid eye area, corners of mouth, nostrils\n19. Start every other night to minimize irritation\n20. Expect dryness, redness, peeling initially - use moisturizer\n21. Takes 8-12 weeks to see full effect - be patient\n22. Use sunscreen daily - increased photosensitivity\n23. Avoid waxing on retinoid (can cause skin tears)\n24. If trying to conceive in future: Stop retinoid (pregnancy category)\n\nScarring:\n\n25. Current scars are mild\n26. Priority: Prevent new acne and scarring\n27. Once acne controlled, can consider:\n    - Chemical peels\n    - Microneedling\n    - Laser treatments\n    - Dermatology referral for scar treatment later\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n26. Return in 8-12 weeks to assess response\n27. Call if severe irritation or new concerns\n28. If not responding: May add oral antibiotic or adjust regimen\n29. If severe acne develops: Dermatology referral for isotretinoin consideration\n\nPrescriptions:\n\n30. Adapalene 0.1% gel 45g - apply nightly\n31. Benzoyl peroxide 5% gel (OTC) - apply morning\n\nEducation:\n\n32. Acne treatment takes time - minimum 8-12 weeks\n33. Consistency is key - use products daily\n34. Initial worsening (purging) is normal with retinoids\n35. Don't stop when skin clears - continue maintenance\n36. Picking worsens scarring - hands off!"

Start with corticosteroid injection today for symptomatic relief\n   - Given current symptoms and need for relief\n   - Quick acting, covered by insurance\n6. If repeated steroid injections needed, consider viscosupplementation as alternative\n7. PRP: Discuss if interested, but cost and evidence limitations\n\nProcedure Today:\n\n8. Corticosteroid injection right knee\n   - Medication: Triamcinolone 40 mg + 4 mL 1% lidocaine\n   - Approach: Lateral suprapatellar or anterolateral\n   - Aseptic technique\n9. Post-injection:\n   - May have temporary increase in pain 24-48 hours (steroid flare)\n   - Ice PRN\n   - Rest from strenuous activity 24-48 hours\n   - Effect takes 2-7 days\n\nOngoing Management:\n\n10. Weight loss: Continue efforts - every pound lost = 4 lbs reduced stress on knee\n11. Exercise:\n    - Low-impact: Swimming, cycling, elliptical\n    - Strengthen quadriceps (critical for OA)\n    - Avoid high-impact (running, jumping)\n12. Physical therapy: Consider refresher course or home program\n13. Acetaminophen: Continue PRN (max 3g/day)\n14. Topical NSAIDs: Diclofenac gel (Voltaren) - apply to knee TID\n    - Safer than oral NSAIDs with GERD\n15. Knee sleeve/brace for support during activity\n\nGolf:\n\n16. Can continue golfing\n17. Use golf cart\n18. Proper warm-up and stretching\n19. Low-impact, good for maintaining activity\n\nSurgery Discussion:\n\n20. Eventually may need total knee replacement if conservative measures fail\n21. Current Grade 3 OA - will likely progress\n22. Average age for TKA is 65-70 - patient is 55\n23. Goal: Delay surgery as long as reasonably possible while maintaining quality of life\n24. Orthopedic referral when ready to discuss surgical options\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n25. Return in 6-8 weeks to assess response\n26. If good relief: Can repeat injection every 3-4 months as needed (max 3-4/year)\n27. If poor response: Consider viscosupplementation or MRI to evaluate for other pathology\n28. Referral to orthopedics when conservative measures no longer adequate\n\nPatient Education:\n\n29. OA is progressive but manageable\n30. Weight loss and exercise are most important long-term strategies\n31. Injections are temporizing - not curative\n32. Eventually may need surgery, but can be deferred with conservative care\n33. Goal: Stay active, manage symptoms, maintain function"

Anoscopy confirms internal hemorrhoids.\n\nColonoscopy Consideration:\n- Family history of colon cancer in first-degree relative at age 52\n- Per guidelines: Begin screening 10 years before age of diagnosis in relative OR age 40, whichever is earlier\n- Recommendation: Colonoscopy at age 40 (10 years before father's diagnosis at 52)\n- NOT currently indicated at age 28 unless red flag symptoms develop\n\n### Plan\nConservative Management:\n1. High-fiber diet: Goal 25-30g fiber daily\n   - Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes\n2. Fiber supplement: Psyllium (Metamucil) 1 tablespoon daily with water\n3. Increase water intake: 8+ glasses daily\n4. Avoid straining - do not delay urge to defecate\n5. Limit time on toilet (avoid reading/phone)\n6. Sitz baths: Warm water 15-20 minutes, 2-3 times daily\n\nTopical Therapy:\n7. Hydrocortisone 2.5% cream or suppository BID x 7 days (short term only)\n8. Witch hazel pads (Tucks) for soothing PRN\n9. Avoid irritants: Scented soaps, wipes\n\nConstipation Management:\n10. If fiber insufficient: Add Polyethylene glycol (Miralax) 17g daily\n11. Stool softener: Docusate 100mg BID if needed\n\nProcedural Options (if conservative fails):\n12. Rubber band ligation (office procedure) - first-line for Grade II-III\n13. Infrared coagulation\n14. Sclerotherapy\n15. Surgical hemorrhoidectomy reserved for Grade III-IV or failed procedures\n\nCancer Screening:\n16. Colonoscopy recommended at age 40 (family history protocol)\n17. Sooner if: Change in symptoms, weight loss, anemia, change in stool caliber, or persistent symptoms despite treatment\n\nFollow-up:\n18. Return in 6 weeks to assess response\n19. Return sooner if increased bleeding, pain, or new symptoms\n20. GI referral if refractory to conservative management for banding procedure"

Biologic therapy indicated:\n   - Moderate-severe disease\n   - Failed 5-ASA\n   - Goal: Achieve and maintain remission without steroids\n\n4. First-line biologic options:\n\n   a) TNF-alpha Inhibitors (First-line for moderate-severe Crohn's):\n   - Infliximab 5 mg/kg IV at 0, 2, 6 weeks, then q8 weeks\n   - Adalimumab 160 mg SQ day 1, 80 mg day 15, then 40 mg q2 weeks\n   - Certolizumab, Golimumab\n\n   b) Anti-Integrin (Vedolizumab):\n   - Gut-selective, lower systemic immunosuppression\n   - 300 mg IV at 0, 2, 6 weeks, then q8 weeks\n   - Slower onset, good for maintenance\n\n   c) IL-12/23 Inhibitor (Ustekinumab):\n   - Weight-based IV induction, then 90 mg SQ q8 weeks\n   - Good efficacy, favorable safety\n\n   d) IL-23 Inhibitors (Risankizumab - newer):\n   - IV induction, then SQ maintenance\n\n5. Recommended for this patient:\n   - Infliximab + Azathioprine (or Methotrexate) combination\n   - Combination therapy superior to monotherapy for moderate-severe disease\n   - Reduces antibody formation to biologic\n\n6. Alternative: Adalimumab (if prefers self-injection at home)\n\nPre-Biologic Workup:\n\n7. TB screening: QuantiFERON or PPD (latent TB must be treated before anti-TNF)\n8. Hepatitis B (HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs) - reactivation risk\n9. Hepatitis C\n10. HIV\n11. Baseline labs: CBC, CMP, LFTs\n12. Varicella immunity (if no history, check titer)\n13. Vaccinations:\n    - Update before starting biologic\n    - Influenza, Pneumococcal, Hepatitis B, Shingrix\n    - AVOID live vaccines (MMR, Varicella, live zoster) on biologics\n\nImmunomodulator:\n\n14. Add Azathioprine 2-2.5 mg/kg/day OR\n15. Methotrexate 15-25 mg SQ weekly + Folic acid 1 mg daily\n16. Check TPMT before azathioprine (avoid toxicity in poor metabolizers)\n17. Combination with biologic improves outcomes\n\nMonitoring on Therapy:\n\n18. CRP, fecal calprotectin every 3 months\n19. Clinical assessment (stool frequency, pain, weight)\n20. If on thiopurine: CBC and LFTs regularly (myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity)\n21. Drug levels (infliximab trough) if loss of response\n\nNutrition:\n\n22. Iron deficiency anemia: IV iron (oral poorly absorbed in active disease)\n    - Iron sucrose or ferric carboxymaltose\n23. Monitor B12 and folate (ileal disease)\n24. Nutritional supplementation\n25. High-calorie, high-protein diet\n26. Consider enteral nutrition if unable to maintain weight\n\nBone Health:\n\n27. Steroids increase osteoporosis risk\n28. Calcium 1000-1200 mg + Vitamin D 1000-2000 IU daily\n29. DEXA scan if prolonged steroids\n\nSurveillance:\n\n30. Colonoscopy: Repeat in 6-12 months to assess mucosal healing\n31. Goal: Endoscopic remission (not just clinical)\n32. Dysplasia surveillance every 1-2 years (long-standing colonic disease)\n\nNo Current Surgical Indications:\n\n33. No stricture, no abscess, no perforation\n34. Surgery reserved for:\n    - Refractory disease despite medical therapy\n    - Stricture with obstruction\n    - Abscess/fistula\n    - Dysplasia/cancer\n\nSmoking:\n\n35. Confirm non-smoker (smoking worsens Crohn's, must quit)\n36. If smoking: Cessation is critical\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n37. GI follow-up in 2-4 weeks after starting biologic\n38. Labs as above\n39. Assess steroid taper\n40. Long-term GI follow-up for disease monitoring"

Monitoring:\n   - Vital signs q4h\n   - Strict I/O\n   - Daily BMP, CBC, lipase\n   - Assess for organ failure (respiratory, renal, cardiovascular)\n\n**GALLSTONE-SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT:**\n\n6. ERCP Consideration:\n   \n   Indications for URGENT ERCP in Gallstone Pancreatitis:\n   - Cholangitis (fever, jaundice, RUQ pain + altered mental status)\n   - Persistent biliary obstruction (worsening LFTs, bilirubin rising)\n   \n   Current Status:\n   - No cholangitis (no ascending infection signs)\n   - LFTs elevated but stone may have passed\n   - Monitor: If LFTs don't improve in 24-48h, consider ERCP\n\n7. Cholecystectomy (Definitive Treatment):\n   - MUST remove gallbladder to prevent recurrent pancreatitis\n   - Timing: During SAME hospitalization (index admission)\n     - For MILD pancreatitis: Cholecystectomy within 7 days\n     - Before discharge to prevent recurrence (25-30% recur without surgery)\n   - Surgical consult for laparoscopic cholecystectomy\n   - Wait until: Lipase trending down, pain improving, tolerating diet\n\n**NUTRITION:**\n\n8. Early Oral Feeding (When Appropriate):\n   - Old practice: Prolonged NPO - NOT recommended\n   - Current evidence: Early oral feeding when:\n     - Nausea/vomiting resolved\n     - Pain improving\n     - Hungry\n   - Start with: Low-fat, solid diet (not clear liquids first)\n   - Usually within 24-48 hours for mild pancreatitis\n   - No need to wait for lipase normalization\n\n9. If Prolonged NPO Needed:\n   - Enteral nutrition (NG/NJ tube) preferred over TPN\n   - Start enteral feeding within 72 hours if cannot eat\n   - TPN only if enteral not tolerated\n\n**ANTIBIOTICS:**\n\n10. Prophylactic Antibiotics: NOT Indicated\n    - No role for prophylactic antibiotics in acute pancreatitis\n    - Even with necrosis, antibiotics don't prevent infection\n    - Only use antibiotics if:\n      - Confirmed infected necrosis\n      - Cholangitis\n      - Other documented infection\n\n**MONITORING FOR COMPLICATIONS:**\n\n11. Watch for Severity Progression:\n    - Repeat Ranson criteria at 48 hours\n    - Monitor for organ failure:\n      - Respiratory: Hypoxia, ARDS\n      - Renal: Rising creatinine\n      - Cardiovascular: Persistent hypotension\n    - If organ failure: Severe pancreatitis, consider ICU\n\n12. Local Complications:\n    - Acute peripancreatic fluid collections (early)\n    - Pancreatic pseudocyst (>4 weeks)\n    - Necrosis (infected or sterile)\n    - If suspected: Repeat CT in 5-7 days if not improving\n\n**MEDICATIONS TO HOLD:**\n\n13.

Uncomplicated diverticulitis can often be treated OUTPATIENT\n2. Criteria for outpatient management:\n   - No significant comorbidities \u2713\n   - Able to tolerate oral intake \u2713\n   - No signs of sepsis \u2713\n   - No peritonitis \u2713\n   - Reliable follow-up \u2713\n3. This patient: Outpatient treatment appropriate\n\nDietary Management:\n4. Clear liquid diet initially (1-2 days)\n5. Advance to low-residue diet as symptoms improve\n6. Then gradually return to regular diet\n7. Long-term: HIGH FIBER diet after recovery (prevents recurrence)\n\nAntibiotics:\n8. Outpatient oral antibiotics:\n   - Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID + Metronidazole 500 mg PO TID x 7-10 days, OR\n   - Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID x 7-10 days, OR\n   - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole DS + Metronidazole (but patient has sulfa allergy)\n9. For this patient (sulfa allergy): Ciprofloxacin + Metronidazole x 7-10 days\n10. Note: Recent studies suggest uncomplicated diverticulitis may not require antibiotics\n    - AGA guidelines: Antibiotics can be selectively used\n    - Still commonly prescribed, especially with fever and leukocytosis\n\nPain Management:\n11. Acetaminophen 1000 mg q6h PRN\n12. AVOID NSAIDs (may increase perforation risk)\n13. Avoid opioids if possible (constipating)\n14. Dicyclomine 20 mg QID PRN for cramping\n\nBowel Regimen:\n15. Avoid constipation:\n    - MiraLAX 17 g daily if needed\n    - Adequate hydration\n16. Stool softener: Docusate 100 mg BID\n\nHydration:\n17. Encourage oral fluids (2-3 L/day)\n18.

Admit if:\n    - Unable to tolerate oral intake\n    - Significant comorbidities (immunosuppression, diabetes)\n    - Signs of sepsis\n    - Complicated diverticulitis (abscess, perforation)\n    - Failed outpatient treatment\n    - Unreliable follow-up\n20. This patient: Outpatient appropriate\n\nFollow-up:\n21. Recheck in 2-3 days (phone or office visit)\n22. Expected improvement in 2-3 days\n23. If not improving or worsening \u2192 return to ED\n24. Complete antibiotic course\n\nColonoscopy:\n25. Colonoscopy AFTER acute episode resolves (6-8 weeks)\n26. Reasons:\n    - Confirm diverticulosis extent\n    - Rule out underlying malignancy (can mimic diverticulitis)\n    - Important given family history of colon cancer\n27. Do NOT perform colonoscopy during acute episode (perforation risk)\n28. Patient is due for colonoscopy anyway (last one 5 years ago, family history)\n\nRecurrence Prevention:\n29. HIGH FIBER diet after recovery:\n    - Goal: 25-35 g fiber daily\n    - Sources: Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes\n    - Increase gradually to avoid bloating\n30. Hydration: 8 glasses water daily\n31. Regular exercise\n32. Weight management\n33. Avoid smoking (patient quit \u2713)\n34. Avoid seeds/nuts restriction: NOT evidence-based (old myth)\n35. Reduce red meat consumption\n\nRecurrence Risk:\n36. After first episode: ~20-30% recurrence risk\n37. Risk factors for recurrence:\n    - Young age at first episode\n    - Long segment involvement\n    - Family history\n38. Elective surgery generally NOT recommended after first uncomplicated episode\n\nSurgical Indications:\n39. Elective sigmoid resection considered for:\n    - Recurrent episodes (traditionally after 2nd episode, now individualized)\n    - Complicated diverticulitis\n    - Immunosuppressed patients\n    - Inability to rule out cancer\n    - Persistent symptoms\n40. Emergency surgery for:\n    - Free perforation with peritonitis\n    - Uncontrolled sepsis\n    - Obstruction\n41. This patient: No surgical indication at this time\n\nReturn Precautions:\n42. Return to ED immediately if:\n    - Worsening abdominal pain\n    - High fever (>102\u00b0F)\n    - Inability to tolerate liquids\n    - Vomiting\n    - Significant abdominal distension\n    - Bloody stools\n    - Signs of peritonitis (rigid abdomen)\n43. These may indicate perforation, abscess, or treatment failure\n\nChronic Management:\n44. After recovery: High-fiber diet lifelong\n45. Regular colonoscopies per guidelines\n46. Consider fiber supplementation (psyllium) if dietary intake insufficient\n47. Mesalamine: No evidence for preventing recurrence\n48. Probiotics: Insufficient evidence currently\n\nFollow-up:\n49. Phone check in 2-3 days\n50. Office visit if not improved by day 3-4\n51. Colonoscopy scheduled in 6-8 weeks\n52. Gastroenterology referral for colonoscopy\n53.

Refer to multidisciplinary breast cancer team:\n   - Breast surgical oncologist\n   - Medical oncologist\n   - Radiation oncologist\n   - Genetics counselor\n   - Breast nurse navigator\n2. Tumor board presentation\n\nStaging Workup:\n3. Complete staging before treatment planning:\n4. CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis:\n   - Evaluate for distant metastases (lungs, liver)\n5. Bone scan OR PET-CT:\n   - Evaluate for bone metastases\n   - PET-CT increasingly used for staging\n6. MRI Breast (optional but often done):\n   - Evaluate extent of disease in affected breast\n   - Evaluate contralateral breast\n   - May change surgical planning\n7. If axillary node suspicious:\n   - FNA or core biopsy of suspicious axillary lymph node\n   - Will change staging and treatment approach\n\nLaboratory:\n8. CBC, CMP, LFTs (baseline)\n9. Consider CA 27-29 or CA 15-3 (tumor marker, for baseline)\n\nGenetic Testing:\n10. Strong indication for genetic counseling and testing:\n    - Age <50 at diagnosis \u2713\n    - Family history of breast and ovarian cancer \u2713\n11. BRCA1/BRCA2 testing (multi-gene panel testing now standard)\n12. Results will affect:\n    - Surgical decision (consideration for bilateral mastectomy)\n    - Risk-reducing oophorectomy discussion\n    - Screening for family members\n13. Refer to cancer genetics before surgery if possible\n\nSurgical Options:\n14. Discuss with surgical oncologist:\n\n15. Breast-Conserving Surgery (Lumpectomy) + Radiation:\n    - Appropriate for single tumor <5 cm with adequate breast size\n    - Requires clear margins\n    - Equivalent survival to mastectomy\n    - Must be able to receive radiation\n    - Followed by whole breast radiation\n\n16. Mastectomy:\n    - Total mastectomy with or without reconstruction\n    - Consider if:\n      - Patient preference\n      - Multicentric disease\n      - Unable to achieve clear margins\n      - BRCA positive (prophylactic consideration)\n      - Contraindication to radiation\n    - Reconstruction options: Immediate vs delayed\n\n17. Axillary Staging:\n    - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) at time of surgery\n    - If clinically positive nodes (FNA positive): May need neoadjuvant chemo first\n    - If SLNB positive: Consider axillary dissection vs radiation\n\nNeoadjuvant vs Adjuvant Therapy:\n18. Consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy if:\n    - Large tumor (>2 cm) - borderline in this case\n    - Node-positive disease\n    - To downstage for breast conservation\n    - Provides in vivo assessment of response\n19. For ER+/HER2- tumors:\n    - Less chemosensitive than triple-negative\n    - Oncotype DX or MammaPrint can guide chemotherapy decision\n20. This patient: May be candidate for surgery first, then adjuvant therapy\n\nAdjuvant Systemic Therapy:\n21. Endocrine Therapy (Cornerstone for ER+ disease):\n    - Premenopausal: Tamoxifen 20 mg daily x 5-10 years\n      - May add ovarian suppression (GnRH agonist) if high risk\n    - Alternative: Ovarian suppression + Aromatase inhibitor\n22. Chemotherapy Decision:\n    - Order Oncotype DX (21-gene recurrence score) on tumor specimen\n    - If Recurrence Score low (<26): Endocrine therapy alone\n    - If Recurrence Score high (\u226531): Chemotherapy benefit\n    - Intermediate scores: Consider patient factors\n23. Typical chemotherapy regimens (if indicated):\n    - TC (docetaxel/cyclophosphamide)\n    - AC-T (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by taxane)\n\nRadiation Therapy:\n24. If breast-conserving surgery:\n    - Whole breast radiation required\n    - Typically 3-6 weeks of treatment\n    - With or without boost to tumor bed\n25. If mastectomy:\n    - Radiation if node-positive or large tumor (>5 cm)\n    - Chest wall and regional nodes\n\nReconstructive Surgery:\n26. Discuss with plastic surgery if mastectomy chosen:\n    - Implant-based reconstruction\n    - Autologous tissue reconstruction (DIEP, TRAM)\n    - Immediate vs delayed reconstruction\n27. Radiation affects reconstruction options\n\nFertility Preservation:\n28. Patient is 45, premenopausal\n29. Discuss fertility goals before starting treatment\n30. If future fertility desired:\n    - Refer to reproductive endocrinology BEFORE chemotherapy\n    - Options: Egg/embryo freezing, ovarian tissue preservation\n31. Endocrine therapy will be long-term (5-10 years)\n\nPsychosocial Support:\n32. Assess coping, anxiety, depression\n33. Social work referral\n34. Support group referral\n35. Patient education materials\n36. Address work/family concerns\n\nFollow-up and Monitoring (After Treatment):\n37. After primary treatment:\n    - Clinical exam every 3-6 months for 5 years, then annually\n    - Annual mammography\n    - Endocrine therapy compliance\n    - Bone density monitoring if on aromatase inhibitor\n38. Surveillance for recurrence\n39. Management of treatment side effects\n\nNext Steps:\n40. Complete staging workup within 1-2 weeks\n41. Genetic counseling appointment\n42. Surgical oncology consultation\n43. Medical oncology consultation\n44. Tumor board review\n45. Patient to bring support person to appointments\n46. Treatment plan finalized after staging complete"

        "output": "### Subjective\nPatient is a 58-year-old male presenting with a bulge at the umbilicus noticed for 6 months. Bulge becomes more prominent when straining, coughing, or lifting. Able to push it back in (reducible). Occasionally causes mild discomfort with heavy lifting. No sharp pain. No nausea, no vomiting. Normal bowel function. No symptoms of obstruction. Bulge has slowly increased in size over 6 months. Concerned about appearance and possibility of getting worse.\n\nRisk Factors:\n- Obesity (BMI 32)\n- Works in warehouse (heavy lifting)\n- History of significant weight fluctuations\n\nPast Medical History: Hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity\nMedications: Metformin 1000 mg BID, Lisinopril 20 mg daily\nAllergies: No known drug allergies\nSurgical History: None\nSocial: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol, warehouse worker with heavy lifting\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Blood Pressure: 142/88 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 78 bpm\n- BMI: 32 kg/m\u00b2\n- Temperature: 98.6\u00b0F\n\nPhysical Examination:\nAbdomen:\n- Inspection:\n  - Visible bulge at umbilicus\n  - Enlarges with Valsalva maneuver\n  - No skin changes, no erythema\n  - No ecchymosis\n- Palpation:\n  - Umbilical hernia defect palpable: ~4 cm diameter\n  - Hernia content: Soft, likely omentum or fat\n  - REDUCIBLE: Contents reduce with gentle pressure when supine\n  - Non-tender\n  - No signs of incarceration (not stuck out)\n  - No signs of strangulation (not painful, no color change)\n  - Cough impulse present\n- Auscultation: Normal bowel sounds\n- Rest of abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no other hernias\n\nOther Hernia Sites:\n- Inguinal regions: No hernias bilaterally\n- Femoral regions: No hernias\n\nGeneral:\n- Well-appearing\n- Obese body habitus\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Umbilical Hernia, Symptomatic, Reducible (ICD-10: K42.9)\n\nHernia Characteristics:\n- Size: 4 cm defect (larger than 1-2 cm, less likely to resolve spontaneously)\n- Reducibility: Reducible \u2713\n- Symptoms: Mild (discomfort with lifting, cosmetic concern)\n- Complications: None currently\n\nRisk of Complications Without Repair:\n- Incarceration: ~5-10% lifetime risk\n- Strangulation: Risk increases with narrow defects (this defect is larger)\n- Larger defects may be at lower risk of strangulation but don't resolve spontaneously\n\nSurgical Candidacy:\n- Symptomatic hernia: Repair indicated\n- Surgical risks: Moderate (obesity, diabetes)\n- Would benefit from weight loss before surgery if possible\n\n### Plan\nSurgical Consultation:\n1. Refer to general surgery for elective umbilical hernia repair\n2. Repair indicated for symptomatic hernia\n3. Elective timing - not urgent\n\nPreoperative Optimization:\n4. Weight loss strongly recommended before surgery:\n   - Goal: Lose 10-15% body weight (20-30 lbs)\n   - Reduces surgical complications\n   - Reduces recurrence risk\n   - May take 3-6 months\n5. Diabetes optimization:\n   - A1c goal <8% (ideally <7%) before elective surgery\n   - Check current A1c\n   - Better glycemic control improves wound healing\n6. Blood pressure control: Continue current regimen\n7. Smoking cessation: Already non-smoker \u2713\n\nWatchful Waiting (Alternative):\n8. Can observe small, minimally symptomatic hernias\n9. Risk of observation: Potential for incarceration, need for emergency surgery\n10. For this patient: Symptomatic, 4 cm defect \u2192 repair recommended\n11. If chooses observation: Must understand warning signs\n\nHernia Belt/Binder (Temporizing):\n12. Umbilical hernia binder may provide symptom relief\n13. Does NOT treat or reduce hernia\n14. May use while waiting for surgery or weight loss\n15. Not a substitute for surgical repair\n\nSurgical Repair Options:\n16. Open Umbilical Hernia Repair:\n    - Traditional approach\n    - Small incision at umbilicus\n    - Primary repair (sutures) vs mesh repair\n    - Mesh recommended for defects >1-2 cm (this patient)\n    - Reduces recurrence rate\n\n17. Laparoscopic Umbilical Hernia Repair:\n    - Minimally invasive\n    - Mesh placed intraperitoneally\n    - Potentially faster recovery\n    - May be preferred in obese patients (better visualization)\n    - Surgeon preference\n\n18. For this patient:\n    - 4 cm defect \u2192 MESH repair recommended\n    - Open vs laparoscopic: Discuss with surgeon\n    - Both acceptable\n\nMesh Considerations:\n19. Mesh repair: Lower recurrence rate for defects >1-2 cm\n20. Types:\n    - Synthetic (polypropylene, polyester)\n    - Biologic (for contaminated fields - not needed here)\n21. Placement:\n    - Inlay, onlay, sublay (retromuscular), or underlay (intraperitoneal)\n    - Sublay may have best outcomes\n22. Mesh complications: Infection, seroma, recurrence, chronic pain\n\nPreoperative Workup:\n23. Standard preoperative labs:\n    - CBC, BMP, PT/INR\n    - A1c (for diabetes status)\n    - Type and screen (usually not needed for routine hernia)\n24. EKG (age >50 with diabetes/HTN)\n25. Consider cardiology clearance if cardiac history\n26. Imaging: Not typically needed for clinically obvious hernia\n    - CT if concern for occult hernia, incisional hernia, or complex anatomy\n\nAnesthesia:\n27. General anesthesia typically used\n28. Local with sedation possible for open repair in select patients\n29. Anesthesia evaluation for surgical clearance\n\nPostoperative Expectations:\n30. Outpatient surgery (same-day discharge)\n31. Recovery:\n    - Pain: Moderate, 1-2 weeks\n    - Activity: Light activity immediately, avoid lifting >10 lbs x 4-6 weeks\n    - Work: Desk job 1-2 weeks, heavy labor 4-6 weeks\n32. Wound care: Keep clean and dry\n33. Diet: Regular diet\n\nComplications to Discuss:\n34. Wound infection: ~2-5% (higher in obese, diabetics)\n35. Seroma/hematoma\n36. Recurrence: 1-10% depending on technique, higher with primary repair\n37. Chronic pain (mesh-related)\n38. Mesh infection (rare)\n39. Injury to bowel (rare)\n\nActivity Restrictions Preoperatively:\n40. Avoid heavy lifting if possible (may worsen hernia)\n41. Use hernia belt if helpful\n42. Lose weight through diet and low-impact exercise\n\nWarning Signs (While Awaiting Surgery):\n43. Return to ED immediately if:\n    - Hernia becomes painful and cannot be pushed back (incarceration)\n    - Nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension (obstruction)\n    - Skin over hernia becomes red, warm, discolored (strangulation)\n    - Fever\n44. These are surgical emergencies\n\nFollow-up:\n45. Surgery consultation within 2-4 weeks\n46. Weight loss program/dietitian referral\n47. A1c check and diabetes optimization\n48. Pre-surgical testing before surgery date\n49. Elective surgery date to be scheduled"

Admit to surgical service\n2. NPO\n3. IV access, IV fluid resuscitation\n4. Foley catheter (monitor urine output)\n5. Surgical consultation\n\nNon-Operative (Conservative) Management:\n6. Trial of conservative management is appropriate for:\n   - Partial SBO \u2713\n   - Adhesive etiology \u2713\n   - No signs of strangulation \u2713\n   - No closed-loop obstruction \u2713\n7. Success rate: 65-80% for partial adhesive SBO\n\nNasogastric Tube:\n8. Insert NGT for decompression\n9. Low intermittent suction\n10. Measure output (document volume and character)\n11. Helps decompress stomach, reduce vomiting, prevent aspiration\n\nIV Fluid Resuscitation:\n12. IV fluids: Lactated Ringer's or Normal Saline\n13. Initial bolus: 1-2 liters\n14. Then maintenance + replacement of NGT losses\n15. Goal: Restore intravascular volume, correct AKI\n16. Monitor urine output (goal >0.5 mL/kg/hr)\n\nElectrolyte Management:\n17. Check and replace electrolytes:\n    - K: 3.4 (borderline) - may need replacement\n    - Replete K to >4.0\n18. Correct any metabolic alkalosis from vomiting\n19. Monitor BMP daily\n\nAnticoagulation:\n20. Patient on apixaban for AFib\n21. HOLD anticoagulation during acute SBO\n22. Risk of bleeding if surgery needed\n23. Resume when resolved and taking PO (if no surgery)\n24. Low risk of thromboembolic event during short hold\n\nMonitoring During Conservative Trial:\n25. Serial abdominal exams every 6-8 hours\n26. Vital signs every 4 hours\n27. Strict I&O\n28. Daily labs: BMP, CBC, lactate\n29. Document NGT output\n30. Assess for passage of flatus or stool\n\nWater-Soluble Contrast (Gastrografin) Study:\n31. Consider Gastrografin challenge:\n    - Give 100 mL Gastrografin via NGT\n    - Obtain abdominal X-ray at 4-8 and 24 hours\n32. Purposes:\n    - Diagnostic: If contrast reaches colon by 24 hours, high likelihood of resolution\n    - Therapeutic: Osmotic effect may promote resolution\n33. If contrast in colon at 24 hours: Likely to resolve with conservative management\n34. If no contrast in colon at 24 hours: Consider surgery\n\nSigns of Failure of Conservative Management:\n35. Watch for indications for surgery:\n    - Peritonitis develops (rebound, guarding, rigid abdomen)\n    - Fever, rising WBC\n    - Rising lactate (bowel ischemia)\n    - Worsening abdominal pain\n    - Failure to resolve after 48-72 hours\n    - Complete obstruction not improving\n    - Hemodynamic instability\n\nSurgical Intervention (If Needed):\n36. Indications for surgery:\n    - Signs of strangulation or bowel ischemia\n    - Peritonitis\n    - Complete obstruction not resolving\n    - Closed-loop obstruction\n    - Failure of conservative management (48-72 hours)\n37. Surgical options:\n    - Exploratory laparotomy (traditional for SBO)\n    - Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions (select cases, experienced surgeon)\n38. Intraoperative: Lyse adhesions, assess bowel viability, resect if necrotic\n\nDVT Prophylaxis:\n39. SCDs (sequential compression devices) while in bed\n40. Pharmacologic prophylaxis: Consider after 24-48 hours if stable and surgery not imminent\n41. Early ambulation when possible\n\nNutrition:\n42. NPO during acute phase\n43. No TPN needed for short-term obstruction (expected to resolve)\n44. If prolonged (>5-7 days), consider TPN\n45. When resolving: Start clear liquids, advance diet gradually\n\nResolution Criteria (For Diet Advancement):\n46. Resolution of SBO indicated by:\n    - Passage of flatus or stool\n    - Decreasing abdominal distension\n    - Resolution of pain and nausea\n    - Decreased NGT output (<500 mL/24 hours)\n    - Return of appetite\n47. When resolved:\n    - Clamp NGT, trial PO clears\n    - If tolerating, remove NGT\n    - Advance diet as tolerated\n\nPrevention of Recurrence:\n48. Adhesive SBO recurrence rate: 10-30%\n49. No proven prevention method\n50. Low-fiber diet during recovery\n51. Chew food well\n52. Seek care early if symptoms recur\n\nDischarge Planning (When Resolved):\n53. Diet: Low-fiber initially, advance to regular\n54. Activity: As tolerated\n55. Resume anticoagulation (apixaban) after tolerating diet\n56. Resume home medications\n57. Follow-up with surgery in 2-4 weeks\n58. Return immediately if: Recurrent vomiting, distension, abdominal pain, obstipation\n\nPatient/Family Education:\n59. Explain that adhesive SBO has recurrence risk\n60. Early recognition of symptoms important\n61. Seek medical care promptly if symptoms recur\n62. Surgery may eventually be needed if recurrent episodes"

Patient was unaware of any neck mass. Denies neck pain, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, difficulty breathing. No palpable lump noted by patient. No symptoms of hyperthyroidism (no palpitations, weight loss, heat intolerance, tremor). No symptoms of hypothyroidism (no fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation). No prior thyroid issues. No history of neck radiation. No family history of thyroid cancer.\n\nPast Medical History: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia\nMedications: Amlodipine 5 mg daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg daily\nAllergies: No known drug allergies\nSurgical History: C-section x2\nFamily History: No thyroid cancer, mother with hypothyroidism\nSocial: Non-smoker, occasional wine\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Blood Pressure: 126/78 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 72 bpm (regular)\n- Weight: 165 lbs\n\nPhysical Examination:\n- Neck:\n  - Thyroid: Palpable nodule in right lobe, approximately 3 cm\n  - Nodule: Firm, smooth, mobile, non-tender\n  - Left lobe: Normal, no nodules\n  - No cervical lymphadenopathy\n  - Trachea: Midline\n- General: Well-appearing, no signs of hypo- or hyperthyroidism\n- Eyes: No proptosis, no lid lag\n- Skin: Normal, no pretibial myxedema\n- Reflexes: Normal (no delayed relaxation)\n- Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, no tachycardia\n\nLaboratory:\n- TSH: 2.1 mIU/L (normal: 0.5-4.5) - Euthyroid\n- Free T4: 1.2 ng/dL (normal)\n- Thyroglobulin: 35 ng/mL (can be elevated with nodules, non-specific)\n- Calcitonin: Not obtained (would check if MTC suspected)\n\nImaging:\n- CT Neck (incidental finding):\n  - Right thyroid lobe: 3.0 cm hypodense nodule\n  - No lymphadenopathy\n  - Trachea non-deviated\n\n- Thyroid Ultrasound:\n  - Right lobe: 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm solid hypoechoic nodule\n  - Smooth margins, no microcalcifications\n  - No suspicious features for papillary carcinoma\n  - Internal vascularity present\n  - Left lobe: Normal, no nodules\n  - No lymphadenopathy\n  - TI-RADS category: TR4 (moderately suspicious) - FNA recommended\n\nCytology:\n- Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA):\n  - Bethesda Category IV: Follicular Neoplasm\n  - Microfollicular architecture\n  - Cannot distinguish benign follicular adenoma from follicular carcinoma on cytology\n  - Requires surgical excision for definitive diagnosis\n  - Risk of malignancy: 25-40%\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Thyroid Nodule, Right Lobe - Follicular Neoplasm (Bethesda IV) (ICD-10: E04.1, D44.0)\n\nBethesda Classification:\n- I: Non-diagnostic\n- II: Benign\n- III: Atypia of Undetermined Significance (AUS)\n- IV: Follicular Neoplasm or Suspicious for Follicular Neoplasm \u2190 THIS PATIENT\n- V: Suspicious for Malignancy\n- VI: Malignant\n\nClinical Significance of Bethesda IV:\n- Cannot differentiate follicular adenoma (benign) from follicular carcinoma (malignant) on FNA\n- Requires histological evaluation (capsular/vascular invasion only seen on surgical specimen)\n- Risk of malignancy: 25-40%\n- Surgical excision is standard recommendation\n\nFavorable Features:\n- Euthyroid\n- No suspicious sonographic features (no microcalcifications)\n- No lymphadenopathy\n- Mobile nodule on exam\n- No family history of thyroid cancer\n- No radiation history\n\n### Plan\nSurgical Management:\n1. Recommend surgical excision for definitive diagnosis\n2. Refer to endocrine/thyroid surgeon\n3. Surgery is the only way to determine if benign vs malignant\n\nSurgical Options:\n4. Thyroid Lobectomy (Hemithyroidectomy):\n   - Removal of right thyroid lobe and isthmus\n   - Preferred initial approach for Bethesda IV\n   - Preserves contralateral lobe (no lifelong thyroid replacement if benign)\n   - If pathology shows malignancy: May need completion thyroidectomy\n   - ~70% will be benign on final pathology\n\n5. Total Thyroidectomy:\n   - Consider if:\n     - Large nodule (>4 cm) - borderline in this case\n     - Patient preference (avoid possible second surgery)\n     - Bilateral nodular disease\n     - Family history concerning for MEN2 or familial thyroid cancer\n   - Disadvantage: Requires lifelong thyroid hormone replacement\n\n6. For this patient:\n   - Thyroid lobectomy (right) is appropriate initial approach\n   - 3 cm nodule, unilateral disease\n   - Discuss with patient: Risk of second surgery if cancer found vs avoiding thyroid hormone replacement if benign\n\nMolecular Testing (Alternative to Immediate Surgery):\n7. Molecular testing on FNA specimen can help stratify risk:\n   - Afirma Gene Expression Classifier (GEC)\n   - ThyroSeq v3 (next-generation sequencing)\n   - ThyGenX/ThyraMIR\n8. May help avoid surgery if \"benign\" molecular profile\n9. High \"suspicious\" result \u2192 strengthens indication for surgery\n10. Discuss with patient: Molecular testing vs proceeding to surgery\n11. In this case: Patient may prefer definitive surgery given 3 cm size\n\nPreoperative Workup:\n12. Complete metabolic panel\n13. CBC, coagulation studies\n14. EKG (if indicated for age/comorbidities)\n15. Preoperative laryngoscopy (assess vocal cord function before surgery)\n16. Anesthesia evaluation\n\nPreoperative Counseling:\n17. Surgical risks:\n    - Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (hoarseness) - ~1%\n    - Hypoparathyroidism (hypocalcemia) - transient ~10%, permanent <1% for lobectomy\n    - Bleeding/hematoma\n    - Wound infection\n    - Need for thyroid hormone replacement (total thyroidectomy)\n18. Hospital stay: Often overnight observation or same-day discharge\n19. Voice use: Minimize for 1 week post-op\n20. Lifting restriction: 10 lbs x 2 weeks\n\nPostoperative Management:\n21. Thyroid lobectomy:\n    - Check TSH in 6-8 weeks\n    - ~20-30% will need thyroid hormone replacement even with lobectomy\n22. If total thyroidectomy:\n    - Lifelong levothyroxine replacement\n    - Calcium monitoring (hypocalcemia risk)\n23. Pathology review in 1-2 weeks\n\nFinal Pathology Scenarios:\n24. If benign (follicular adenoma - ~60-75%):\n    - No further surgery needed\n    - Routine follow-up\n    - Check TSH periodically\n\n25. If malignant (follicular carcinoma - ~25-40%):\n    - May need completion thyroidectomy (if only lobectomy done)\n    - Staging workup\n    - Possible radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation\n    - TSH suppression with levothyroxine\n    - Oncology/Endocrinology follow-up\n    - Generally good prognosis for well-differentiated thyroid cancer\n\nWhile Awaiting Surgery:\n26. No specific treatment needed\n27. Thyroid nodule is not causing symptoms\n28. No need for thyroid hormone unless hypothyroid\n29. Avoid iodine supplements (no benefit, may interfere with future RAI if needed)\n\nPatient Education:\n30. Explain that FNA cannot determine if follicular neoplasm is benign or malignant\n31. Surgery is needed for diagnosis\n32. Majority (~70%) of Bethesda IV nodules are benign\n33. If cancer, thyroid cancers generally have excellent prognosis\n34. Discuss voice changes risk and calcium monitoring\n\nFollow-up:\n35. Endocrine surgery consultation in 1-2 weeks\n36. Surgical scheduling\n37. Preoperative testing\n38. Post-surgical follow-up for pathology review\n39. Endocrinology follow-up for thyroid hormone management if needed"

Monitor: Continuous cardiac monitor, pulse ox, Foley for urine output\n6. NPO\n\nLaboratory Monitoring:\n7. Serial CBC every 6 hours until stable\n8. Repeat BMP\n9. Coagulation studies (INR, PTT)\n10. Lactate trending\n11. Type and screen current\n\nProton Pump Inhibitor Therapy:\n12. IV PPI - HIGH DOSE:\n    - Pantoprazole 80 mg IV bolus, then\n    - Pantoprazole 8 mg/hour continuous infusion (72 hours)\n    - OR intermittent: Pantoprazole 80 mg IV q12h\n13. High-dose IV PPI reduces rebleeding after endoscopic therapy\n14. Transition to oral PPI after stabilization\n\nAntiemetics/Prokinetics:\n15. Erythromycin 250 mg IV x1 (30-60 minutes before EGD):\n    - Prokinetic effect, improves gastric visualization at endoscopy\n    - Clears blood/clots from stomach\n16. Ondansetron 4 mg IV PRN nausea\n\nUrgent Endoscopy:\n17. Consult GI for URGENT EGD\n18. Timing: Within 24 hours (ideally <12 hours given severity)\n19.

Test for H. pylori during EGD:\n    - Rapid urease test (CLO test) on biopsy\n    - Histology\n32. If positive: Eradication therapy after acute episode\n    - Triple therapy: PPI + Clarithromycin + Amoxicillin x 14 days, OR\n    - Quadruple therapy: PPI + Bismuth + Metronidazole + Tetracycline\n33. Confirm eradication 4-6 weeks after treatment (urea breath test or stool antigen)\n\nPost-Endoscopy Management:\n34. Continue IV PPI x 72 hours after endoscopic therapy (high-risk ulcer)\n35. If low-risk ulcer (clean base): Can transition to oral PPI sooner\n36. Diet: NPO until stable, then clear liquids, advance as tolerated\n37. Repeat endoscopy: Only if rebleeding, not routinely\n\nPreventing NSAID-Induced Ulcer Recurrence:\n38. STOP chronic NSAID use if possible\n39. Alternative pain management for osteoarthritis:\n    - Acetaminophen (first-line for OA)\n    - Topical NSAIDs (diclofenac gel) - less GI risk\n    - Physical therapy\n    - Weight loss\n    - Intra-articular corticosteroid injections\n    - Consider duloxetine for chronic pain\n40. If NSAID absolutely necessary:\n    - Use lowest effective dose, shortest duration\n    - Co-prescribe PPI for gastroprotection\n    - Consider celecoxib (COX-2 selective) + PPI\n    - Avoid in high-risk patients if possible\n\nDischarge Medications:\n41. PPI: Omeprazole 40 mg PO BID x 8 weeks (ulcer healing), then 40 mg daily\n42. No NSAIDs\n43. H. pylori treatment if positive\n44. Resume lisinopril when hemodynamically stable\n\nFollow-up:\n45. GI follow-up in 2-4 weeks\n46. Repeat EGD in 8-12 weeks to document ulcer healing (especially gastric ulcers - r/o malignancy)\n47. PCP follow-up for alternative pain management\n48. Consider orthopedic referral for knee pain management\n\nRisk Stratification for Discharge:\n49. Low risk for rebleeding after endoscopy:\n    - Hemodynamically stable\n    - No high-risk endoscopic features\n    - Can take oral PPI\n    - Reliable follow-up\n50. High-risk patients: ICU monitoring x 24-48 hours\n51. This patient: Likely ICU or step-down initially given instability"

I&D of pilonidal abscess indicated now\n2. Can be performed in ED or outpatient surgery setting\n3. Local anesthesia (lidocaine 1% with epinephrine, buffered)\n4. Incision should be lateral to midline when possible (better healing)\n5. Express purulent material, break up loculations\n6. Probe for sinus tracts\n7. Irrigate cavity\n8. Wound packing: Iodoform or plain gauze strip\n\nI&D Procedure Details:\n9. Position: Prone or lateral decubitus\n10. Prep and drape, create sterile field\n11. Local anesthesia: Consider field block\n12. Elliptical incision or simple stab incision depending on size\n13. Obtain culture (optional - usually polymicrobial, skin flora)\n14. Curette cavity (debride granulation tissue)\n15. Pack wound loosely - do not close primarily\n16. Dress with absorbent gauze\n\nAntibiotics:\n17. Antibiotics NOT routinely needed for uncomplicated abscess after I&D\n18. Consider antibiotics if:\n    - Significant surrounding cellulitis\n    - Immunocompromised\n    - Signs of systemic infection\n    - Incomplete drainage\n19. This patient: Minimal cellulitis, afebrile \u2192 Likely no antibiotics needed\n20. If antibiotics indicated (penicillin allergy):\n    - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole DS BID + Metronidazole, OR\n    - Clindamycin 300 mg TID x 7 days\n\nWound Care:\n21. Daily packing changes:\n    - Remove packing daily (in shower for ease)\n    - Clean wound with saline or shower water\n    - Repack with new gauze strip\n    - Cover with absorbent dressing\n22. Continue until wound heals from base up (secondary intention)\n23. May take 4-8 weeks for complete healing\n24. Can teach patient/family to do at home or arrange home health\n\nPain Management:\n25. Acetaminophen 1000 mg q6h PRN\n26. Ibuprofen 600 mg TID PRN (patient has no contraindication)\n27. Sitz baths for comfort\n28. Avoid sitting on hard surfaces, use cushion\n\nRecurrence Prevention (Conservative Measures):\n29. Hair removal from natal cleft:\n    - Shaving, depilatory creams, or laser hair removal\n    - Reduces hair embedding and recurrence\n    - Extend 2-3 cm on each side of midline\n30. Hygiene: Keep area clean and dry\n31. Weight loss if overweight\n32. Avoid prolonged sitting when possible\n33. Avoid trauma to area\n\nDefinitive Surgical Options (For Recurrent Disease):\n34. Given this is RECURRENT pilonidal disease, discuss definitive surgery:\n\n35. Options for definitive treatment:\n\n    a) Wide Excision with Primary Closure:\n       - Excise sinus tract and surrounding tissue\n       - Primary closure (midline or off-midline)\n       - Faster healing, but higher recurrence if midline closure\n\n    b) Excision with Off-Midline Closure (Karydakis Flap, Bascom Cleft Lift):\n       - Excision with closure lateral to midline\n       - Flattens natal cleft\n       - Lower recurrence rate (~5%)\n       - Gold standard for recurrent disease\n\n    c) Wide Excision with Secondary Intention Healing:\n       - Excise all affected tissue\n       - Leave wound open to heal\n       - Lower recurrence but prolonged healing (months)\n\n    d) Rhomboid Flap (Limberg Flap):\n       - Excision with flap coverage\n       - Good for large defects\n       - Requires plastic surgery expertise\n\n36. Recommendation for this patient:\n    - Off-midline closure technique (Karydakis or Bascom) preferred\n    - Lowest recurrence rate for recurrent disease\n    - Refer to colorectal surgeon or general surgeon with expertise\n\nReferral:\n37. Refer to general surgery or colorectal surgery for:\n    - Discussion of definitive surgical options\n    - Elective definitive surgery after acute infection resolves (4-6 weeks)\n38. Surgery can be done once acute inflammation has settled\n\nFollow-up:\n39. Wound check in 2-3 days\n40. Evaluate healing, ensure no undrained collection\n41. Weekly wound checks until healed or comfortable with self-care\n42. Surgical consultation after acute phase (4-6 weeks)\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n43. Keep wound clean and dry\n44. Daily dressing changes after shower\n45. Sitz baths for comfort\n46. Hair removal as discussed\n47. Avoid prolonged sitting\n48. Return if:\n    - Fever\n    - Increasing pain, redness, swelling\n    - Foul-smelling drainage\n    - Not improving within 1 week\n49. Take all antibiotics if prescribed\n50. Use donut cushion or pillow when sitting"

URGENT inguinal hernia repair indicated\n22. Timing: Within 4-6 hours of presentation\n23. Approach:\n    - Open inguinal hernia repair (preferred for incarcerated)\n    - Laparoscopic repair: May be used in experienced hands, but open often preferred for emergency\n\nIntraoperative Considerations:\n24. Open the hernia sac and inspect bowel viability\n25. Viable bowel: Reduce and repair hernia\n26. Non-viable bowel (gangrenous, necrotic): Resect and anastomose\n    - Signs of non-viability: Black/gray color, no peristalsis, no bleeding\n    - If questionable: Wrap in warm saline, re-evaluate in 10-15 minutes\n27. Mesh use:\n    - If clean field and bowel viable: Mesh repair (lower recurrence)\n    - If contaminated (bowel perforation/necrosis): Consider tissue repair only (Bassini, Shouldice) - mesh infection risk\n    - Newer data supports mesh even in some contaminated cases\n28. Hernia repair technique: Lichtenstein (tension-free mesh) if appropriate\n\nPostoperative Care:\n29. NPO until bowel function returns\n30. IV fluids\n31. Pain management: Multimodal (acetaminophen, NSAIDs if appropriate, minimal opioids)\n32. DVT prophylaxis: SCDs, early ambulation\n33. Monitor for:\n    - Return of bowel function (flatus, BM)\n    - Signs of bowel ischemia (if bowel was compromised)\n    - Wound infection\n    - Urinary retention (especially with BPH)\n34. If bowel resection: May have ileus, longer recovery\n\nComplications to Monitor:\n35. Wound infection (higher if contaminated)\n36. Bowel leak (if anastomosis)\n37. Ileus\n38. Urinary retention (common in elderly males with BPH)\n39. Recurrence (long-term)\n40. Chronic pain (mesh-related)\n\nDiabetes Management:\n41. Hold metformin for 48 hours after surgery\n42. Sliding scale insulin perioperatively\n43. Monitor blood glucose closely\n44. Resume metformin when eating and renal function stable\n\nDischarge Planning:\n45. If uncomplicated (viable bowel, simple repair):\n    - Discharge in 1-2 days\n    - Diet: Advance as tolerated\n    - Activity: No lifting >10 lbs x 4-6 weeks\n    - Wound care: Keep incision clean and dry\n46. If bowel resection:\n    - Longer hospital stay (3-5+ days)\n    - Ensure bowel function before discharge\n\nPrevention of Future Hernias:\n47. Treat constipation (avoid straining)\n48. Optimize BPH treatment (avoid straining to urinate)\n49. Avoid heavy lifting or use proper technique\n50. Weight management\n51. Smoking cessation (if applicable)\n\nFollow-up:\n52. Surgeon follow-up in 1-2 weeks\n53. PCP follow-up for diabetes, medication management\n54. Watch for signs of wound infection, recurrence\n55.

NPO\n\n2. IV Fluid Resuscitation:\n   - LR or NS bolus\n   - Maintenance fluids\n   - Monitor urine output\n\n3. IV Antibiotics (Broad-Spectrum):\n   - Cover gram-negatives and anaerobes\n   - Piperacillin-Tazobactam 3.375g IV q6h, OR\n   - Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily + Metronidazole 500mg IV q8h, OR\n   - Ciprofloxacin 400mg IV q12h + Metronidazole 500mg IV q8h\n\n4. Pain management: IV opioids (avoid masking peritoneal signs)\n\n5. DVT prophylaxis: Heparin SQ or SCDs\n\nAbscess Drainage (Hinchey II):\n\n6. Percutaneous CT-guided drainage:\n   - Abscess >4 cm typically requires drainage\n   - Interventional radiology consult\n   - Place drain, send fluid for culture\n\n7. Benefits of drainage:\n   - Avoids emergent surgery\n   - Allows inflammation to settle\n   - Enables elective/delayed surgery with lower morbidity\n\n8. Monitor drain output, character\n\nMonitoring:\n\n9. Serial abdominal exams (every 6-8 hours)\n10. Daily labs (WBC, lactate)\n11. Temperature monitoring\n12. Watch for clinical improvement (48-72 hours expected)\n\nExpected Response:\n\n13. Clinical improvement within 48-72 hours:\n    - Decreasing fever\n    - Decreasing WBC\n    - Improving pain\n    - Decreasing drain output\n\n14. If NOT improving:\n    - Repeat imaging\n    - May need surgical intervention\n\nIndications for Emergent Surgery:\n\n15. Free perforation with peritonitis (Hinchey III-IV)\n16. Failed drainage/worsening sepsis\n17. Clinical deterioration despite adequate treatment\n18. Hemodynamic instability\n\nSurgical Options (if needed):\n\n16. Emergent:\n    - Sigmoid resection + end colostomy (Hartmann's procedure)\n    - Resection with primary anastomosis \u00b1 diverting loop ileostomy\n\n17. Goal: Avoid emergent surgery with drainage + antibiotics\n\nElective Surgery (After Recovery):\n\n18. Indications for elective sigmoid colectomy:\n    - Complicated diverticulitis (abscess, fistula, stricture)\n    - Recurrent diverticulitis (guidelines evolving - individualized)\n    - Immunocompromised patients\n    - Unable to exclude malignancy\n\n19. Timing: 6-8 weeks after acute episode resolves\n\n20. Procedure: Sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis (usually laparoscopic)\n\n21. Benefits of elective surgery:\n    - Lower morbidity than emergent\n    - Single-stage (no colostomy)\n    - Prevents future episodes\n\nTransition to Oral Antibiotics:\n\n22. When tolerating diet and afebrile:\n    - Metronidazole 500 mg PO TID + Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID, OR\n    - Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg PO BID\n    - Complete 10-14 day total course\n\nDiet:\n\n23. Clear liquids when improved, advance as tolerated\n24. Low-residue diet during recovery\n25. Long-term: High-fiber diet after recovery (prevents future episodes)\n\nColonoscopy:\n\n26. Colonoscopy 6-8 weeks after resolution:\n    - Rule out underlying malignancy\n    - Colon cancer can mimic diverticulitis\n    - Not during acute episode (perforation risk)\n\nLifestyle Modifications:\n\n27. Smoking cessation (increases complications)\n28. Weight loss\n29. High-fiber diet (20-35g/day)\n30. Adequate hydration\n31. Regular exercise\n\nPatient Education:\n\n32. Diverticulitis is inflammation/infection of colon outpouchings\n33. Abscess required drainage\n34. May need surgery later to prevent recurrence\n35. Lifestyle changes can reduce future episodes\n36. Return immediately if: Worsening pain, fever, inability to eat/drink\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n37. Surgical follow-up in 2 weeks\n38. Colonoscopy in 6-8 weeks\n39. Discuss elective sigmoid resection\n40.

Incentive spirometry (COPD patient)\n19. Early ambulation\n\nPost-Operative:\n\n20. Drain placement (often for large repairs)\n21. Abdominal binder for support (6-8 weeks)\n22. Limit lifting to <10 lbs x 4-6 weeks\n23. Wound care instructions\n24. Resume metformin when eating\n\nComplications to Monitor:\n\n25. Surgical site infection (SSI) - higher risk with obesity, DM\n26. Seroma (common, usually resolves)\n27. Hematoma\n28. Mesh infection\n29. Recurrence\n30. Chronic pain\n\nRecurrence Prevention:\n\n31. Mesh repair (lower recurrence than suture)\n32. Retromuscular mesh position (lower recurrence)\n33. Weight management\n34. Smoking cessation\n35. Control diabetes\n36. Avoid heavy lifting initially\n\nAlternative - Watchful Waiting:\n\n37. Option for minimally symptomatic, high-risk patients\n38. Risks: Enlargement, incarceration (10-15% over time)\n39. Patient counseling on warning signs\n\nDischarge Planning:\n\n40. Typical stay 2-4 days for open repair\n41. Drain removal when output <30 mL/day\n42. Follow-up in 2 weeks\n43. Abdominal binder use\n44. Gradual return to activities\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n45. Surgeon follow-up 2 weeks post-op\n46.

POLYPHARMACY is major contributor - goal is to reduce unnecessary medications\n2. Medications to STOP or REDUCE (Fall-Risk-Increasing Drugs - FRIDs):\n\n   a) Trazodone 50 mg: STOP\n      - Sedating, contributes to falls\n      - Alternative for sleep: Sleep hygiene, melatonin if needed\n   \n   b) Gabapentin 300 mg TID: REDUCE\n      - Sedating, causes dizziness\n      - Taper to 300 mg BID, then daily, then stop if tolerated\n      - Or switch to topical for neuropathic pain\n   \n   c) Metoprolol 50 mg BID: REDUCE\n      - Contributing to orthostatic hypotension\n      - Reduce to 25 mg BID if HR allows (AFib rate control needed)\n      - Monitor HR and BP\n   \n   d) Lisinopril 20 mg: REDUCE\n      - Contributing to orthostatic hypotension\n      - Reduce to 10 mg, reassess BP control\n   \n   e) Glipizide 5 mg: STOP\n      - Hypoglycemia risk in elderly\n      - Can cause dizziness, falls\n      - Metformin alone may be sufficient, A1c 7.2% acceptable\n   \n   f) Omeprazole: Reassess\n      - Long-term PPI use associated with B12 deficiency, fractures\n      - Taper if no strong indication\n\n3. Continue essential medications: Warfarin (AFib), levothyroxine, alendronate\n4. Schedule follow-up to reassess after medication changes\n\nOrthostatic Hypotension Management:\n5. Education: Rise slowly from sitting/lying\n6. Sit on edge of bed 1-2 minutes before standing\n7. Dorsiflexion exercises before standing (pump ankles)\n8. Hydration: Ensure adequate fluid intake (unless restricted)\n9. Avoid large meals, hot environments\n10. Compression stockings (waist-high preferred)\n11. Reduce antihypertensive dose (as above)\n12. If persistent: Consider fludrocortisone or midodrine (with caution)\n\nPhysical Therapy Referral:\n13. PT for gait training and balance exercises\n14. Otago Exercise Program or similar evidence-based fall prevention\n15. Progressive strength training for lower extremities\n16. Assistive device evaluation (proper cane or walker fitting)\n17. Home safety assessment by PT/OT\n\nOccupational Therapy:\n18. Home safety evaluation\n19. Remove throw rugs, improve lighting\n20. Install grab bars in bathroom\n21. Consider bedroom on first floor\n22. Night lights for bathroom trips\n23. Evaluate need for shower chair, raised toilet seat\n\nVitamin D Supplementation:\n24. Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily (level is 22, goal >30)\n25. Vitamin D improves muscle strength and reduces falls\n26. Recheck level in 3 months\n\nVision and Hearing:\n27. Ophthalmology referral for comprehensive eye exam\n28. Update glasses prescription if needed\n29. Audiology evaluation for hearing aids if appropriate\n30. Correcting sensory deficits improves balance and safety\n\nFootwear:\n31. Proper footwear: Low-heeled, non-slip soles, secure fit\n32. Avoid slippers, socks only, or going barefoot\n33. Podiatry referral for bunions, calluses\n\nCognitive Impairment:\n34. MoCA 22 indicates MCI - warrants further evaluation\n35. Consider: B12 supplementation (level low-normal)\n36. TSH normal \u2713\n37. Depression contributing? Optimize treatment\n38. Consider neuropsychological testing if decline continues\n39. Discuss cognitive strategies with patient and family\n\nOsteoporosis and Fracture Prevention:\n40. Continue alendronate (reduces fracture risk)\n41. Vitamin D supplementation (as above)\n42. Falls increase fracture risk - prevention critical\n43. Consider hip protectors (low compliance but may help)\n\nAnticoagulation Consideration:\n44. On warfarin for AFib - appropriate but increases bleeding risk with falls\n45. Falls with head strike: Risk of intracranial hemorrhage\n46. Document fall precautions, patient aware of risks\n47. Consider CHA2DS2-VASc (likely high) vs HAS-BLED\n48. Continue anticoagulation but emphasize fall prevention\n49. Educate family on head injury warning signs\n\nSocial Support:\n50. Lives alone - concerning given fall risk\n51. Involve daughter in safety planning\n52. Consider personal emergency response system (Life Alert, etc.)\n53. Daily check-ins with family\n54. Discuss future living arrangements if falls continue\n55. Social work consult for support services\n\nAdvance Care Planning:\n56. Discuss goals of care\n57. Health care proxy, advance directives\n58. Document code status\n59. Given multiple comorbidities and functional decline, important conversation\n\nFollow-up:\n60. Return in 2-4 weeks to assess medication changes\n61. Orthostatic BP recheck\n62. PT/OT progress\n63. Falls diary - track any new falls\n64. Urgent return if any fall with head injury (given anticoagulation)"

Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) \u2713 - Most likely primary trigger\n2. Dehydration with hypernatremia \u2713\n3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) - prerenal (Cr 2.1 from 1.4) \u2713\n4. Anticholinergic medication - Oxybutynin (NEW) \u2713\n   - Strong anticholinergic \u2192 causes delirium, especially in elderly with dementia\n5. Urinary retention (450 mL PVR) - discomfort, worsened by oxybutynin\n\nDelirium Features:\n- Acute onset (2 days)\n- Fluctuating course\n- Inattention (cardinal feature)\n- Change from baseline\n- CAM positive\n\n### Plan\nTreat Underlying Causes:\n\n1. UTI Treatment:\n   - Empiric antibiotics pending culture:\n     - Ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily (cover common uropathogens), OR\n     - Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q12h (if not recently used)\n   - Adjust based on culture and sensitivities\n   - Duration: 7 days for complicated UTI in elderly male\n   - Check for source: Catheter-associated? (No catheter)\n\n2. IV Hydration:\n   - NS bolus 500 mL, then 75-100 mL/hr\n   - Correct hypernatremia gradually (Na 148)\n   - Goal: Improve volume status, correct AKI\n   - Monitor urine output\n\n3. STOP Oxybutynin:\n   - DISCONTINUE immediately\n   - Strong anticholinergic - major delirium trigger\n   - Anticholinergic burden very high in this patient\n   - Alternative for urge incontinence: Behavioral approaches, mirabegron (beta-3 agonist, less anticholinergic)\n\n4. Urinary Retention:\n   - Foley catheter temporarily (PVR 450 mL)\n   - May be caused by oxybutynin (anticholinergic) + tamsulosin insufficiency\n   - Continue tamsulosin\n   - Trial of void after UTI treated and oxybutynin out of system\n\nDelirium Management (Non-Pharmacological - First Line):\n5. Reorientation:\n   - Visible clock and calendar in room\n   - Reorient frequently (\"You are in the hospital, it's daytime\")\n   - Family at bedside (wife)\n   - Familiar objects from home\n\n6. Sleep-Wake Cycle:\n   - Minimize nighttime disruptions\n   - Open curtains during day\n   - Avoid daytime sedation\n   - Quiet environment at night\n\n7. Mobility:\n   - Get out of bed during day if safe\n   - Physical therapy consult\n   - Avoid physical restraints (worsen delirium)\n\n8. Sensory Optimization:\n   - Ensure glasses and hearing aids are on\n   - Adequate room lighting\n\n9. Avoid Deliriogenic Medications:\n   - Avoid benzodiazepines (worsen delirium)\n   - Avoid diphenhydramine and other anticholinergics\n   - Avoid opioids if possible\n   - Review all medications for anticholinergic burden\n\n10. Minimize Tethers:\n    - Avoid unnecessary IV lines, catheters (Foley temporary)\n    - Remove as soon as feasible\n\nPharmacological Management (If Severe Agitation Only):\n11. Antipsychotics - Use only if:\n    - Severe agitation posing safety risk\n    - After non-pharmacological measures fail\n12. If needed:\n    - Haloperidol 0.5-1 mg PO/IM q4-6h PRN, OR\n    - Quetiapine 12.5-25 mg PO BID (less EPS, but more sedation)\n    - Avoid in Parkinson's, Lewy body dementia\n13. Use lowest dose, shortest duration\n14. Monitor for QTc prolongation (check EKG before antipsychotics)\n15. This patient: Try non-pharmacological first\n\nContinue Dementia Medications:\n16. Continue donepezil 10 mg daily\n17. Continue memantine 10 mg BID\n18. These may help with delirium recovery\n\nMonitoring:\n19. Serial cognitive assessments (CAM daily)\n20. Monitor for improvement as infections treated\n21. Renal function - expect Cr to improve with hydration\n22. Sodium - recheck in 12-24 hours\n23. I&O monitoring\n24. Fall precautions (high risk)\n\nCaregiver Education:\n25. Explain delirium vs dementia to wife:\n    - Delirium is ACUTE, REVERSIBLE with treatment\n    - Dementia is baseline, chronic\n    - Expect fluctuating course\n    - May take days to weeks to fully resolve\n26. Wife's presence is therapeutic\n27. Reassure that aggressive behavior is part of delirium, not intentional\n\nPrevent Hospital Complications:\n28. Fall precautions - bed alarm, supervised ambulation\n29. Aspiration precautions - may have swallowing issues during delirium\n30. DVT prophylaxis - SCDs, heparin if immobile\n31. Skin care - turn frequently, pressure ulcer prevention\n32. Avoid polypharmacy - minimize new medications\n\nAnticholinergic Burden Review:\n33. Use Anticholinergic Burden Scale to review all medications\n34. Oxybutynin was major contributor - now stopped\n35. Ensure no other high-anticholinergic medications\n\nDischarge Planning:\n36. When delirium resolves:\n    - Home with wife (current arrangement)\n    - May need increased home support temporarily\n    - PT/OT evaluation before discharge\n    - Ensure safe home environment\n37. If prolonged delirium or functional decline:\n    - May need short-term rehab\n38. Discuss goals of care, prognosis with family\n\nFollow-up:\n39. PCP follow-up within 1 week of discharge\n40. Urology follow-up for urinary retention\n41. Cognitive reassessment in 1 month (delirium may unmask progression of dementia)\n42. Geriatrics follow-up for comprehensive assessment"

Advanced Chronic Heart Failure (Stage C-D)\n2. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 4\n3. Moderate Alzheimer's Dementia (progressing)\n4. Frailty Syndrome\n5. Malnutrition/Weight Loss\n6. Caregiver Burnout\n\nPrognosis Considerations:\n- Multiple advanced organ failures (CHF EF 35%, CKD Stage 4)\n- Progressive dementia\n- Significant functional decline\n- Weight loss\n- Limited life expectancy (likely months to 1-2 years)\n\nLevel of Care Needed:\n- Current: Living with daughter, needs almost total assistance\n- Daughter unable to continue as sole caregiver\n- Needs higher level of care: Assisted living or skilled nursing facility\n\n### Plan\nComprehensive Geriatric Assessment Summary:\n1. This visit completes a comprehensive geriatric assessment\n2. Findings: Significant decline in all domains (medical, functional, cognitive, social)\n3. Key issue: Care needs exceed what daughter can provide at home\n\nMedical Optimization:\n\n4. CHF Management:\n   - Continue current regimen\n   - BP 108/62 - may need to reduce lisinopril if symptomatic hypotension\n   - BNP elevated but stable\n   - Symptom control goal\n\n5. CKD:\n   - Cr slightly elevated (3.0 from 2.8)\n   - Monitor, avoid nephrotoxins\n   - Consider stopping metformin if eGFR <30 (currently ~18-20)\n   - Continue to manage conservatively (dialysis unlikely appropriate given overall status)\n\n6. Diabetes:\n   - STOP glipizide (hypoglycemia risk in CKD, elderly)\n   - STOP metformin (contraindicated in CKD Stage 4)\n   - Less aggressive glucose control appropriate (A1c goal 7.5-8.5%)\n   - May need low-dose insulin if glucose very high, or no diabetes meds given prognosis\n\n7. Polypharmacy:\n   - Deprescribing indicated given prognosis and goals\n   - Consider stopping:\n     - Omeprazole (reassess indication)\n     - Statin if on one (benefit less certain in limited life expectancy)\n   - Continue: Apixaban (stroke prevention still important unless fall risk outweighs)\n\nMedication Reconciliation:\n8. Review all medications with pharmacist and family\n9. Focus on symptom control and quality of life\n10. Reduce pill burden where possible\n\nNutritional Support:\n11. Dietitian consult\n12. High-calorie, high-protein diet\n13. Oral supplements (Ensure, Boost)\n14. Liberalize diet (diabetic restrictions less important)\n15. Pleasure eating prioritized\n\nGoals of Care and Advance Care Planning:\n16. Critical conversation with patient (to extent possible) and daughter:\n17. Discuss:\n    - Current health status and trajectory\n    - Prognosis (honest, compassionate discussion)\n    - Patient's values and wishes\n    - Quality of life vs quantity of life\n    - What matters most to him\n18. Review or establish:\n    - Advance directive / living will\n    - Health care proxy (daughter likely)\n    - DNR/DNI status discussion\n    - POLST form if appropriate\n19. Hospice vs Palliative Care Discussion:\n    - If prognosis <6 months and comfort-focused: Hospice appropriate\n    - If prognosis uncertain: Palliative care consultation\n20. Document goals clearly in medical record\n\nCaregiver Support:\n21. Acknowledge daughter's exhaustion and sacrifice\n22. Validate her feelings - caregiving is incredibly hard\n23. Provide resources:\n    - Respite care (short-term relief)\n    - Caregiver support groups\n    - Social work consult for resources\n24. Caregiver's health matters - encourage her to attend to her own needs\n\nPlacement/Disposition Options:\n25. Home with increased services:\n    - Home health aide (many hours/day)\n    - Adult day programs\n    - Visiting nurse\n    - Meals on wheels\n    - May still be insufficient given needs\n\n26. Assisted Living Facility:\n    - Appropriate if dementia unit available\n    - May not meet needs if requires total ADL care\n    - May be transitional\n\n27. Skilled Nursing Facility (Nursing Home):\n    - Likely most appropriate given:\n      - Total dependence in ADLs\n      - Medical complexity (CHF, CKD)\n      - Progressive dementia\n      - Fall risk\n      - Weight loss requiring monitoring\n    - 24-hour nursing care available\n    - Can provide rehabilitation initially if goals are restorative\n\n28. Memory Care Unit:\n    - If dementia is primary issue and behaviors develop\n    - Secure environment\n\n29. Hospice at Home or in Facility:\n    - If prognosis <6 months and comfort-focused\n    - Can receive hospice in nursing home\n    - Provides additional support and symptom management\n\nSocial Work Referral:\n30. Social work consult for:\n    - Facility placement assistance\n    - Insurance/Medicaid planning (long-term care costs)\n    - Family meeting facilitation\n    - Resource identification\n31. Discuss financial considerations:\n    - Medicare covers short-term rehab (skilled nursing)\n    - Medicaid for long-term nursing home care (if eligible)\n    - Private pay options\n    - Long-term care insurance if available\n\nPalliative Care Referral:\n32. Palliative care consultation recommended:\n    - Symptom management\n    - Goals of care discussions\n    - Care coordination\n    - Family support\n33. Can be concurrent with ongoing treatment\n\nPhysical and Occupational Therapy:\n34. PT/OT evaluation:\n    - Assess rehabilitation potential\n    - Assistive device optimization\n    - Safety assessment\n35. Realistic goals given overall trajectory\n\nFamily Meeting:\n36. Schedule family meeting (include all relevant family if possible):\n    - Discuss current status\n    - Goals of care\n    - Placement options\n    - Hospice/palliative care\n    - Decision-making process\n37. Include: Patient (to extent able), daughter, social worker, PCP, +/- palliative care\n\nImmediate Next Steps:\n38. Social work referral today\n39. Medication adjustments (stop glipizide, metformin)\n40. Schedule family meeting\n41. Goals of care discussion with daughter\n42. If acute decompensation: May need hospital; otherwise outpatient transition planning\n\nFollow-up:\n43. Close follow-up during transition\n44. Palliative care or hospice involvement\n45. Support daughter through this difficult time\n46. Reassess as needed based on patient's wishes"

Surgery/Anesthesia (major trigger for delirium in elderly) \u2713\n2. Opioid medication (hydromorphone PCA) - deliriogenic \u2713\n3. Pain (may be undertreated despite PCA) \u2713\n4. Foley catheter in place - tether, discomfort \u2713\n5. Donepezil NOT restarted postoperatively \u2713\n6. Constipation (no BM since surgery) \u2713\n7. Possible dehydration (elevated BUN/Cr, dry mucous membranes) \u2713\n8. Low potassium \u2713\n9. Post-surgical anemia \u2713\n10. Sleep deprivation (ICU/hospital environment) \u2713\n11. Unfamiliar environment \u2713\n\nPostoperative Delirium in Hip Fracture:\n- Incidence: 35-65% in elderly hip fracture patients\n- Associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospitalization, institutionalization\n- Often multifactorial\n- Preventable in many cases\n\n### Plan\nTreat Reversible Causes:\n\n1. Opioid Reduction/Modification:\n   - STOP hydromorphone PCA\n   - Switch to scheduled acetaminophen: 1000 mg q6h (renal dosing)\n   - Low-dose oxycodone 2.5-5 mg q6h PRN for breakthrough pain only\n   - Opioids contribute to delirium - minimize use\n   - Multimodal analgesia approach\n\n2. Restart Donepezil:\n   - Resume donepezil 5 mg daily TONIGHT\n   - Stopping cholinesterase inhibitors can precipitate delirium\n   - Should not have been held postoperatively\n\n3. Remove Foley Catheter:\n   - Remove Foley today (if not contraindicated)\n   - Tethers worsen delirium, infection risk\n   - Use bladder scans if retention concern\n   - May need bedside commode or urinal\n\n4. Treat Constipation:\n   - Bowel regimen: Polyethylene glycol 17 g daily + senna 8.6 mg BID\n   - Bisacodyl suppository if no BM by tomorrow\n   - Ensure adequate hydration\n   - Abdominal distension from constipation causes discomfort\n\n5. Hydration:\n   - IV fluids: 0.9% NS at 75-100 mL/hr until adequate PO intake\n   - Encourage oral fluids when alert\n   - Correct dehydration (elevated BUN/Cr)\n\n6. Electrolyte Correction:\n   - Potassium 3.4 - give KCl 40 mEq PO or IV\n   - Recheck electrolytes tomorrow\n\n7. Address Anemia:\n   - Hgb 9.8 - monitor, transfuse if symptomatic or <7-8\n   - Currently stable, observe\n\nNon-Pharmacological Delirium Management:\n\n8. Reorientation:\n   - Visible clock and calendar in room\n   - Reorient patient frequently (\"You're in the hospital after your hip surgery\")\n   - Staff introduce themselves each interaction\n   - Consistent caregivers if possible\n\n9. Family Presence:\n   - Encourage daughter to stay at bedside as much as possible\n   - Familiar faces reduce agitation\n   - Family can help reorient and reassure\n   - Bring familiar objects from home (photos, blanket)\n\n10. Sleep Hygiene:\n    - Promote day-night cycle\n    - Open curtains during day, dim lights at night\n    - Minimize nighttime interruptions (cluster care)\n    - No stimulants (caffeine) in evening\n    - Avoid sedatives if possible (worsen delirium)\n\n11. Sensory Optimization:\n    - Ensure glasses are on\n    - Hearing aids in if uses them\n    - Adequate room lighting during day\n\n12. Mobility:\n    - Physical therapy for early mobilization\n    - Chair sitting during day\n    - Avoid restraints (worsen delirium, increase injury risk)\n    - Use sitter if needed for safety instead of restraints\n\n13. Minimize Tethers:\n    - Remove IV when possible (PO meds and fluids)\n    - Remove Foley (as above)\n    - Minimal monitoring if stable\n\n14. Environment:\n    - Quiet, calm environment\n    - Minimize room changes\n    - Consistent staff\n    - Avoid ICU if possible (ICU delirium)\n\nPharmacological Management (For Severe Agitation Only):\n\n15. Avoid benzodiazepines (worsen delirium except in alcohol withdrawal)\n\n16. If severe agitation threatens safety:\n    - Haloperidol 0.5-1 mg PO/IM/IV q4-6h PRN\n    - Use lowest effective dose\n    - Check QTc before use (prolongation risk)\n    - Avoid in Parkinson's or Lewy body dementia\n    - Alternative: Quetiapine 12.5-25 mg PO\n\n17. Melatonin 3-5 mg at bedtime:\n    - May help restore sleep-wake cycle\n    - Low side effect profile\n    - Reasonable to try\n\nPain Management Optimization:\n\n18. Scheduled acetaminophen 1000 mg q6h\n19. Ice to surgical site\n20. Positioning (abduction pillow properly placed)\n21. Low-dose opioid PRN only\n22. Assess pain using non-verbal pain scale (e.g., PAINAD)\n23. Adequate pain control reduces delirium, but excess opioids worsen it - balance\n\nSitter/Safety:\n\n24. 1:1 sitter if patient unsafe (climbing out of bed, pulling lines)\n25. Bed alarm\n26. Low bed, mats on floor\n27. AVOID restraints - increase agitation, injury, and delirium duration\n28. If sitter unavailable and safety concern, consider moving to more observable location\n\nMonitoring:\n\n29. CAM assessment every shift\n30. Document delirium status daily\n31. Monitor for improvement as triggers addressed\n32. Delirium may take days to weeks to resolve, even after triggers corrected\n\nOrthopedic Postoperative Care:\n\n33. Continue DVT prophylaxis (heparin or transition to LMWH/DOAC per orthopedics)\n34. PT/OT for mobilization\n35. Weight-bearing status per surgeon\n36. Wound care per protocol\n37. Abduction precautions\n\nDischarge Planning:\n\n38. Once delirium resolves:\n    - May return to assisted living if function returns to baseline\n    - May need short-term skilled nursing for rehabilitation\n    - If delirium prolonged or new functional deficits, may need higher level of care\n39. Family meeting to discuss:\n    - Delirium prognosis (usually resolves, but can take weeks)\n    - Post-discharge needs\n    - Cognitive function may not return to baseline\n40. Geriatrics consult for comanagement if available\n\nConsultations:\n\n41. Geriatrics consult (if available) for delirium management\n42. Physical therapy: Early mobilization\n43. Occupational therapy: Functional assessment\n44. Social work: Discharge planning, family support\n\nFamily Education:\n\n45. Educate daughter:\n    - Delirium is common after hip surgery in elderly\n    - Not the same as permanent dementia worsening\n    - May take days-weeks to resolve\n    - Her presence helps significantly\n    - Warning signs to report\n46. Daughter as partner in care (reorientation, presence)\n\nFollow-up:\n\n47. Daily reassessment of delirium\n48. Expect improvement over 3-7 days with treatment of precipitants\n49. If not improving: Re-evaluate for missed causes (infection, MI, PE, etc.)\n50. Neurology consult if prolonged or atypical features\n51. Outpatient cognitive assessment 4-6 weeks post-discharge to reassess dementia severity"

        "output": "### Subjective\nPatient is a 76-year-old female presenting with urinary incontinence for 6 months, progressively worsening. Describes two types of leakage:\n\n1. Stress incontinence: Leaks urine with coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting. Small amounts.\n2. Urge incontinence: Strong sudden urge to urinate, can't always make it to bathroom in time. Larger volume leaks.\n\nFrequency: Using 3-4 pads daily. Urgency episodes 8-10 times per day. Nocturia 2-3 times per night. Occasional leakage before reaching toilet.\n\nImpact on Quality of Life:\n- Avoiding social outings due to fear of accidents\n- Limits fluid intake (counterproductive)\n- Embarrassed, affects mood\n- Difficulty sleeping (nocturia)\n\nNo dysuria, no hematuria, no fever. No prolapse symptoms (no bulge). No fecal incontinence. Bowel movements regular. Sexually inactive.\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Hypertension\n- Type 2 diabetes\n- Obesity (BMI 32)\n- Osteoarthritis\n- Vaginal deliveries x 3 (all large babies >9 lbs)\n- Hysterectomy (age 52 for fibroids)\n\nMedications:\n- Lisinopril 20 mg daily\n- Metformin 1000 mg BID\n- Acetaminophen PRN\n\nAllergies: No known drug allergies\nSurgical History: Hysterectomy (abdominal), C-section x0 (all vaginal)\nSocial: Non-smoker, no alcohol, retired, lives with husband\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Blood Pressure: 138/82 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 76 bpm\n- Weight: 195 lbs\n- BMI: 32 kg/m\u00b2\n\nGeneral Appearance:\n- Pleasant elderly female\n- Well-appearing\n\nPhysical Examination:\n- Abdomen: Soft, obese, non-tender, no palpable bladder\n- Pelvic Examination:\n  - External: Normal, mild vulvovaginal atrophy\n  - Vaginal: Mild anterior wall prolapse (cystocele, Grade 1)\n  - Cervix: Absent (s/p hysterectomy)\n  - Uterus: Absent\n  - No significant uterine or vault prolapse\n  - Pelvic floor: Weak contraction on Kegel (2/5)\n  - Cough stress test: POSITIVE (leakage with cough when bladder full)\n- Rectal: Normal tone, no fecal impaction\n- Neurological: Intact perineal sensation, intact anal wink, normal lower extremity reflexes\n\nBladder Diary (Patient Completed):\n- Voids: 10-12 times per day\n- Nighttime: 2-3 voids\n- Fluid intake: Only 4 cups daily (restricting fluids)\n- Incontinence episodes: 3-4 per day (mix of stress and urge)\n\nPost-Void Residual (PVR): 50 mL (normal <100-150 mL) - adequate bladder emptying\n\nLaboratory:\n- Urinalysis: Negative (no UTI, no hematuria)\n- Urine culture: Negative\n- BMP: Normal, Glucose 142 (diabetic)\n- A1c: 7.4%\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Mixed Urinary Incontinence (ICD-10: N39.46)\n- Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI)\n- Urge Urinary Incontinence (Overactive Bladder - OAB)\n\nContributing Factors:\n1. Pelvic floor weakness (multiple vaginal deliveries, hysterectomy)\n2. Obesity (BMI 32 - increases intra-abdominal pressure)\n3. Vulvovaginal atrophy (estrogen deficiency)\n4. Mild cystocele (Grade 1)\n5. Diabetes (can contribute to OAB, diabetic cystopathy)\n6. Age-related changes\n\nNo Urinary Retention: PVR 50 mL (good emptying)\n\nNo UTI: Ruled out\n\nSeverity: Moderate (affecting quality of life, social isolation)\n\n### Plan\nBehavioral Interventions (First-Line for All Incontinence):\n\n1. Bladder Training:\n   - Scheduled voiding: Every 2-3 hours during day\n   - Gradually increase interval by 15-30 minutes weekly\n   - Goal: Void every 3-4 hours\n   - Urge suppression: When urge hits, stop, contract pelvic floor, wait for urge to pass, then walk to bathroom\n\n2. Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (Kegel Exercises):\n   - Key for BOTH stress and urge incontinence\n   - Contract pelvic floor muscles (as if stopping urine), hold 5-10 seconds, relax\n   - 10-15 repetitions, 3 times daily\n   - Takes 6-12 weeks to see benefit\n   - May benefit from formal pelvic floor physical therapy referral\n\n3. Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy Referral:\n   - More effective than self-directed Kegels\n   - Biofeedback training\n   - Proper technique instruction\n   - Recommend 6-8 sessions\n\n4. Fluid Management:\n   - Increase fluid intake slightly (6-8 cups daily) - too little concentrates urine, irritates bladder\n   - Avoid bladder irritants: Caffeine, alcohol, carbonated beverages, artificial sweeteners\n   - Limit fluids 2-3 hours before bedtime (helps nocturia)\n\n5. Weight Loss:\n   - BMI 32 - weight loss can significantly improve SUI\n   - Goal: Lose 5-10% of body weight\n   - Reduces intra-abdominal pressure on bladder\n   - Dietitian referral if interested\n\n6. Manage Constipation:\n   - Straining worsens pelvic floor\n   - Adequate fiber, fluids\n   - Stool softeners if needed\n\nVaginal Estrogen (For Urogenital Atrophy):\n7. Topical vaginal estrogen:\n   - Estradiol vaginal cream 0.5 g intravaginally 2x/week, OR\n   - Estradiol vaginal insert (Vagifem/Yuvafem) 10 mcg 2x/week, OR\n   - Estradiol ring (Estring) - replace every 90 days\n8. Benefits: Improves urethral and vaginal tissue, may reduce urgency and SUI\n9. Minimal systemic absorption - safe in most women\n10. Contraindications: Active breast cancer, unexplained vaginal bleeding\n\nPharmacological Management for Urge Incontinence/OAB:\n11. Antimuscarinics (First-Line):\n    - Options:\n      - Oxybutynin ER 5-10 mg daily (start low)\n      - Tolterodine ER 4 mg daily\n      - Solifenacin 5 mg daily\n      - Darifenacin 7.5 mg daily\n    - Caution in elderly: Anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, constipation, cognitive impairment)\n    - Use with caution given age and dementia risk\n    - Start lowest dose, monitor for side effects\n\n12. Beta-3 Agonist (Preferred in Elderly):\n    - Mirabegron (Myrbetriq) 25-50 mg daily\n    - Less anticholinergic side effects than above\n    - May be better tolerated in elderly\n    - Caution: Hypertension (monitor BP)\n    - Recommend this as first choice given age\n\n13. Vibegron (Gemtris) 75 mg daily:\n    - Newer beta-3 agonist\n    - Similar to mirabegron\n    - Alternative option\n\n14. Start one medication, reassess in 4-6 weeks\n15. If insufficient response, can try different class or combination\n\nFor Stress Incontinence:\n16. Behavioral interventions (Kegels, weight loss) are primary treatment\n17. No FDA-approved medications for SUI\n18. Duloxetine (off-label): Some evidence, not first-line, consider if depression coexists\n\nDevices/Pessary:\n19. Incontinence pessary:\n    - Ring or dish pessary can support bladder neck\n    - Reduces stress incontinence\n    - Fitted by provider\n    - Good option for patients preferring non-surgical\n20. Urethral insert (Poise Impressa):\n    - OTC device for stress incontinence\n    - Temporary support during activity\n\nSurgical Options (If Conservative Measures Fail):\n21. For Stress Incontinence:\n    - Midurethral sling (TVT, TOT):\n      - Most effective surgical treatment for SUI\n      - Outpatient procedure\n      - ~80-90% success rate\n      - Risks: Mesh complications, urinary retention, pain\n    - Burch colposuspension: Older procedure, open surgery\n    - Urethral bulking agents: Less invasive, temporary\n\n22. For Urge Incontinence (Refractory OAB):\n    - OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injection into bladder\n    - Sacral neuromodulation (InterStim)\n    - Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS)\n\n23. Referral to urogynecology or urologist if:\n    - Failed conservative/medical management\n    - Considering surgical options\n    - Significant prolapse\n    - Complex cases\n\nCystocele Management:\n24. Grade 1 cystocele - mild\n25. Pessary can address both prolapse and incontinence\n26. Surgery not needed for mild asymptomatic prolapse\n\nFollow-up:\n27. Bladder diary: Continue for 1-2 weeks to track progress\n28. Pelvic floor PT: Schedule initial evaluation\n29. Trial of vaginal estrogen: Start today\n30. Consider mirabegron 25 mg: Start after behavioral interventions established, or concurrently\n31. Return in 6-8 weeks to assess response\n32. If not improving, urogynecology referral for urodynamic testing and surgical evaluation\n\nPatient Education:\n33. Incontinence is common but NOT normal aging - treatable\n34. Behavioral interventions are effective but take time (weeks-months)\n35. Pelvic floor PT is very effective\n36. Medications help OAB symptoms\n37. Surgery is an option if conservative measures fail\n38. Improve quality of life - don't accept incontinence as inevitable\n\nResources:\n39. Provide patient education materials\n40. Support groups for incontinence if available\n41. Absorbent products: Use as needed, but goal is to reduce dependence"

Hypoglycemia risk)\n- Vitamin D: 18 ng/mL (low)\n- B12: 280 pg/mL (low-normal)\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Polypharmacy with Adverse Drug Events (ICD-10: T50.901A)\n\nProblems Identified:\n1. Polypharmacy: 14 medications - excessive\n2. Orthostatic hypotension: BP drop 30/14 mmHg \u2192 Falls risk\n   - Contributing meds: 4 antihypertensives, sertraline\n3. High Anticholinergic Burden: Oxybutynin + Diphenhydramine\n   - Causing: Confusion, constipation, urinary retention, dry mouth\n4. Urinary retention: PVR 180 mL (worsened by anticholinergics)\n5. Cognitive decline: MoCA dropped from 22 to 19 - anticholinergic meds likely contributor\n6. Overtreatment of Diabetes: A1c 6.2% on 2 agents \u2192 Hypoglycemia risk\n7. Bradycardia: HR 58 on metoprolol\n8. Hypokalemia: K 3.2 from HCTZ\n9. Constipation: Caused by anticholinergics, opioid-like effect of gabapentin\n10. Falls: 2 in 6 months - multifactorial (orthostasis, sedating meds, gait)\n11. Aspirin for Primary Prevention: No longer recommended in >70 (bleeding risk outweighs benefit)\n12. Long-term PPI: May not be indicated, risks in elderly\n\n### Plan\nDeprescribing Approach:\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY STOPS:**\n\n1. STOP Oxybutynin:\n   - HIGH anticholinergic \u2192 Causing confusion, urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth\n   - BEERS CRITERIA: Avoid in elderly\n   - Urinary retention (PVR 180) - oxybutynin making it worse\n   - Alternative for OAB: Behavioral interventions, mirabegron (if needed)\n\n2. STOP Diphenhydramine:\n   - HIGH anticholinergic \u2192 Causing confusion, sedation, falls, constipation\n   - BEERS CRITERIA: Avoid in elderly\n   - For insomnia: Try sleep hygiene, melatonin 3 mg if needed\n   - Stopping will improve cognition\n\n3. STOP Glipizide:\n   - A1c 6.2% is OVERTREATED in 84-year-old\n   - High hypoglycemia risk (sulfonylurea in elderly with CKD)\n   - BEERS CRITERIA: Avoid long-acting sulfonylureas\n   - Goal A1c in frail elderly: 7.5-8.5%\n   - Metformin alone may suffice, or even stop metformin\n   - Monitor glucose after stopping\n\n4. STOP Aspirin:\n   - Primary prevention (no prior MI, stroke)\n   - USPSTF: Do not initiate aspirin for primary prevention in >60\n   - Bleeding risk exceeds benefit in elderly\n   - Continue only if established ASCVD\n\n5. STOP Hydrochlorothiazide:\n   - On 4 antihypertensives - excessive\n   - Causing hypokalemia (K 3.2)\n   - Contributing to orthostatic hypotension\n   - Dehydration risk in elderly\n   - Reduce antihypertensive burden\n\n**REDUCE/MODIFY:**\n\n6. REDUCE Lisinopril:\n   - Reduce from 20 mg to 10 mg (or stop one BP med)\n   - Contributing to orthostatic hypotension\n   - Monitor BP after changes\n\n7. REDUCE Metoprolol:\n   - HR 58 - bradycardic\n   - Reduce from 50 mg BID to 25 mg BID\n   - Or consider stopping if BP controlled without it\n\n8. REDUCE Gabapentin:\n   - 300 mg TID = 900 mg daily - high for elderly with CKD\n   - Sedating, contributes to falls, cognitive impairment\n   - Reduce to 300 mg BID, then 300 mg daily\n   - Assess if still needed for neuropathy\n   - Alternative: Topical lidocaine patches, capsaicin\n\n9. TAPER Omeprazole:\n   - On 40 mg daily - likely excessive\n   - Long-term PPI risks: B12 deficiency, fractures, C. diff, hypomagnesemia\n   - Try reducing to 20 mg daily, then every other day, then stop\n   - Use PRN H2 blocker (famotidine) if reflux recurs\n   - If true indication (Barrett's, severe GERD), may continue lower dose\n\n**CONTINUE (Reassess Later):**\n\n10. CONTINUE Amlodipine 10 mg (may reduce later if BP low)\n11. CONTINUE Atorvastatin 40 mg:\n    - If patient has ASCVD: Continue\n    - If primary prevention only at age 84: Consider stopping (limited benefit, patient preference)\n12. CONTINUE Metformin (may reduce dose if A1c rises too high, or stop if CKD worsens)\n13. CONTINUE Sertraline:\n    - Depression treatment appropriate\n    - Consider if still needed; can taper if depression resolved\n14. CONTINUE Docusate (may not need if anticholinergics stopped)\n\n**Deprescribing Plan Summary:**\n\n| Medication | Action | Reason |\n|------------|--------|--------|\n| Oxybutynin | STOP | Anticholinergic, urinary retention, confusion |\n| Diphenhydramine | STOP | Anticholinergic, sedation, falls, confusion |\n| Glipizide | STOP | Overtreated (A1c 6.2%), hypoglycemia risk |\n| Aspirin | STOP | Primary prevention not indicated >70 |\n| HCTZ | STOP | Hypokalemia, orthostatic hypotension |\n| Lisinopril | REDUCE to 10 mg | Orthostatic hypotension |\n| Metoprolol | REDUCE to 25 mg BID | Bradycardia, orthostasis |\n| Gabapentin | REDUCE to 300 mg BID | Sedation, falls, CKD |\n| Omeprazole | TAPER to 20 mg, then PRN | Long-term PPI risks |\n\n**Result: From 14 medications \u2192 Target 8-9 medications**\n\nMonitoring After Deprescribing:\n15. Blood pressure: Monitor after stopping HCTZ, reducing lisinopril/metoprolol\n    - Target: Systolic <150 mmHg acceptable in frail elderly\n    - Avoid orthostasis (main goal)\n16. Blood glucose: Monitor after stopping glipizide\n    - May rise initially - acceptable if <200\n    - Metformin alone may maintain A1c ~7-8%\n17. Cognition: Reassess MoCA in 4-6 weeks after stopping anticholinergics\n    - Expect improvement if drug-induced\n18. Falls: Track any new falls\n19. Urinary symptoms: PVR should improve off oxybutynin\n20. Sleep: Monitor after stopping diphenhydramine - try melatonin if needed\n21. Potassium: Recheck after stopping HCTZ\n22. GERD symptoms: Monitor during PPI taper\n\nSafety:\n23. Make changes gradually - don't stop everything at once\n24. Change 1-2 medications per week\n25. Close follow-up during deprescribing\n26. Involve daughter in monitoring\n\nOther Interventions:\n27. Vitamin D supplementation: 2000 IU daily (level 18)\n28. Fall prevention: PT referral, home safety evaluation\n29. Orthostatic hypotension management:\n    - Rise slowly from sitting/lying\n    - Hydration (unless CHF)\n    - Compression stockings\n30. Constipation: May resolve after stopping anticholinergics; if not, add fiber, miralax\n\nGoals of Care:\n31. Discuss with patient and daughter:\n    - Quality of life is primary goal\n    - Reducing pill burden\n    - Preventing falls and hospitalization\n    - Less aggressive disease control appropriate given age/frailty\n32. Patient agrees to deprescribing trial\n\nFollow-up:\n33. Phone check in 1 week after initial changes\n34. Office visit in 4 weeks\n35. Recheck: BP, glucose, electrolytes, cognition\n36. Continue deprescribing stepwise\n37. Goal: Fewer side effects, improved function, reduced falls"

Feeding Tube Discussion:\n   - FEEDING TUBES ARE NOT RECOMMENDED IN ADVANCED DEMENTIA:\n     - Do NOT prolong life\n     - Do NOT prevent aspiration\n     - Do NOT improve quality of life\n     - Do NOT prevent pressure ulcers\n     - Increase discomfort and complications\n   - American Geriatrics Society, AMDA, and hospice guidelines: Avoid feeding tubes in advanced dementia\n   - Recommend careful hand feeding instead\n\n8. Careful Hand Feeding:\n   - Preferred approach in advanced dementia\n   - Comfort feeding: Offer food for pleasure, not volume\n   - Small amounts of favorite foods\n   - If patient refuses, honor that (may indicate end of life)\n   - Hand feeding provides human contact, comfort\n\n9. Hospice Discussion:\n   - Advanced dementia with dysphagia and recurrent infections may qualify for hospice\n   - Criteria: FAST Stage 7 + co-morbidities (aspiration, weight loss, infections)\n   - Hospice provides: Comfort care, symptom management, family support\n   - Discuss benefits of palliative/hospice approach\n\n10. Advance Directive Review:\n    - Confirm healthcare proxy: Daughter\n    - Document code status: Recommend DNR/DNI given prognosis\n    - Document feeding tube preferences (likely decline)\n    - Document hospitalization preferences\n\nSymptom Management:\n\n11. If Comfort-Focused Care:\n    - Continue oral feeding for comfort\n    - Treat symptoms (pain, secretions, agitation)\n    - Avoid burdensome interventions\n    - May discontinue donepezil (limited benefit in advanced dementia)\n\n12. Oral Care:\n    - Meticulous oral hygiene\n    - Reduces aspiration pneumonia risk\n    - Moist swabs if NPO or minimal intake\n\n13. If Aspiration Pneumonia Recurs:\n    - Consider: Comfort measures vs antibiotics\n    - Antibiotics may be reasonable if consistent with goals\n    - Or may choose comfort care only\n    - Discuss preferences in advance\n\nMedication Review:\n\n14. Donepezil:\n    - Consider stopping - limited benefit in advanced dementia\n    - May cause anorexia, nausea\n    - Discuss with family\n\n15. Other medications:\n    - Lisinopril: Continue if no hypotension, or stop if deprescribing\n    - Focus on comfort medications only\n\nFamily Support:\n\n16. Provide education and emotional support to daughter\n17. This is a difficult time - validate her feelings\n18. Social work and chaplain involvement\n19. Caregiver support resources\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n20. Family meeting for goals of care\n21. Hospice referral if appropriate and family agrees\n22. Continue to support patient and family through end-of-life process\n23. Close communication with nursing home staff"

Cardiology Consultation (Electrophysiology):\n   - Urgent referral for pacemaker optimization\n   - Review mode switch parameters\n   - Consider adjusting pacemaker settings to prevent prolonged pause during mode switch\n   - May need to increase lower rate limit or adjust mode switch behavior\n\n2. Pacemaker Reprogramming:\n   - Increase lower rate limit (e.g., from 60 to 70 bpm) to prevent bradycardia\n   - Adjust mode switch parameters (faster VVI rate during mode switch)\n   - Consider rate-smoothing algorithms\n\n3. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Management:\n   - Episode of rapid atrial arrhythmia triggered the event\n   - Rate control: Metoprolol 50 mg BID - adequate? May need adjustment\n   - Consider increasing beta-blocker if tolerated (to slow atrial rates)\n   - Antiarrhythmic consideration: May need rhythm control (amiodarone, etc.) if recurrent\n\n4. Anticoagulation:\n   - Continue apixaban 5 mg BID (appropriate for AFib, CKD)\n   - CHA2DS2-VASc score: High \u2192 Anticoagulation required\n\nSyncope Workup:\n\n5. Echocardiogram:\n   - Assess LV function, valvular disease\n   - Rule out structural causes (aortic stenosis, HOCM)\n   - Likely has baseline cardiomyopathy from prior MI\n   - Order if not done recently\n\n6. Holter/Event Monitor:\n   - Pacemaker interrogation serves similar function\n   - If pacemaker data insufficient, can add external monitor\n   - Pacemaker has diagnostic capability - use device data\n\n7. Additional Testing:\n   - If recurrent syncope despite pacemaker optimization: Consider EP study\n   - Assess for ventricular arrhythmias\n   - Rule out other causes\n\nFall Injury Assessment:\n\n8. Minor injury only (hip bruise)\n9. No head trauma evident\n10. No fracture suspected (ambulating, no focal pain)\n11. If head strike occurred: Would need CT head given anticoagulation\n12. Monitor for delayed symptoms\n\nMedication Review:\n\n13. Metoprolol 50 mg BID:\n    - May be contributing to bradycardia during pause\n    - BUT also helps rate control of AFib\n    - May need to decrease if lower rate limit increased, or keep if needed for rate control\n    - Discuss with EP\n\n14. Continue other medications\n\nDriving:\n\n15. Driving Restriction:\n    - No driving until cause addressed and device optimized\n    - Typical: 1-6 months post-syncope depending on risk\n    - State-specific regulations may apply\n    - EP cardiologist to advise on duration\n\nFall Prevention:\n\n16. Even with device optimization, fall risk present\n17. Home safety assessment\n18. Remove throw rugs, ensure lighting\n19. Consider personal emergency response system (medical alert)\n20. Wife should be aware of emergency response if recurs\n\nPatient Education:\n\n21. Explained: Pacemaker detected arrhythmia with pause correlating with syncope\n22. Device can be adjusted to help prevent this\n23. Need to see cardiologist/EP urgently\n24. If syncope recurs: Lie down immediately if prodrome, call 911 if recurrent\n25. No driving until cleared\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n26. Electrophysiology/Cardiology: Within 1 week (urgent)\n27. Pacemaker reprogramming\n28. Echo if not done recently\n29.

Cervical Myelopathy (likely contributing):\n   - Hyperreflexia in legs, spasticity, positive Babinski bilaterally\n   - Urinary urgency (early bladder dysfunction)\n   - Upper motor neuron signs in presence of cervical stenosis\n   - May be progressing since prior MRI\n\n2. Peripheral Neuropathy (diabetic):\n   - Distal sensory loss, impaired proprioception\n   - Diminished ankle reflexes\n   - Contributes to unsteadiness, especially in dark\n\n3. Vitamin B12 Deficiency (history):\n   - Now treated, levels normal\n   - May have caused some irreversible damage\n\n4. Lower Extremity Weakness:\n   - Mild proximal and distal weakness\n   - Deconditioning likely contributing\n\n5. Osteoarthritis:\n   - Knees and hips - limits mobility, causes pain\n\n6. Low Vitamin D:\n   - Contributes to muscle weakness\n\n7. Visual/Vestibular:\n   - Cataracts treated, but vision changes with age\n   - Possible vestibular component (worse in dark)\n\n8. Fear of Falling:\n   - Significant psychological component\n   - Leads to reduced activity, deconditioning\n\n9. Medication Effect:\n   - Gabapentin can cause dizziness, unsteadiness\n\n### Plan\nCervical Myelopathy Evaluation (Priority):\n\n1. Repeat MRI Cervical Spine with Cord Evaluation:\n   - Prior MRI 2 years ago - need updated imaging\n   - Assess for cord compression, myelomalacia\n   - Clinical signs suggest possible progression (UMN signs, bladder symptoms)\n\n2. Neurosurgery/Spine Surgery Referral:\n   - If MRI shows significant stenosis with cord compression\n   - Surgical decompression may prevent progression\n   - Important to intervene before irreversible damage\n\n3. Urgent evaluation if:\n   - Progressive weakness\n   - Bowel/bladder incontinence\n   - Worsening gait rapidly\n\nPeripheral Neuropathy Management:\n\n4. Continue B12 supplementation (levels normal)\n5. Diabetes control: A1c 7.2% - reasonable, continue metformin\n6. Gabapentin 300 mg TID:\n   - Consider reducing dose (can cause dizziness, falls)\n   - May try 300 mg BID or 200 mg TID\n   - Weigh pain control vs fall risk\n7. Alternative for neuropathic pain: Topical lidocaine, capsaicin\n\nVitamin D:\n\n8. Vitamin D3 2000-4000 IU daily (level 22 - low)\n9. Recheck in 3 months\n10. Vitamin D deficiency contributes to muscle weakness\n\nPhysical Therapy (Essential):\n\n11. PT Referral for:\n    - Gait training\n    - Balance exercises (vestibular, proprioceptive)\n    - Strengthening (especially LE, core)\n    - Assistive device assessment (walker vs other)\n    - Home exercise program\n    - Fall prevention strategies\n\n12. Consider Vestibular PT:\n    - If vestibular component suspected\n    - Worse in dark suggests proprioceptive/vestibular reliance\n\n13. Goal: Improve functional mobility, reduce fall risk\n\nOccupational Therapy:\n\n14. Home safety evaluation\n15. Adaptive equipment assessment\n16. ADL training with gait impairment\n\nAssistive Device:\n\n17. Currently using rolling walker - appropriate\n18. PT to assess if correct device and proper fit\n19. May consider 4-wheeled walker with seat for community\n\nFall Prevention:\n\n20. Home safety modifications:\n    - Remove throw rugs\n    - Improve lighting (especially stairs, bathroom)\n    - Grab bars in bathroom\n    - Night lights\n    - Non-slip mats\n\n21. Personal emergency response system:\n    - Lives alone - critical for safety\n    - Medical alert device\n\n22.

        "output": "### Subjective\nPatient is an 83-year-old male with chronic low back pain from degenerative spine disease, on oxycodone 5 mg QID (20 mg/day) for 3 years. Family brought him in with concerns: increasingly sedated, constipated (no BM in 5 days), had 2 falls in past month. Patient admits to feeling \"foggy\" and tired. Pain relief is partial on current dose (5-6/10 despite medication). Tried to take extra dose once when pain was worse.\n\nPain History:\n- Duration: 10+ years\n- Location: Low back, radiates to hips\n- Character: Constant aching\n- Severity: 5-6/10 on meds, 7-8/10 off meds\n- Aggravating: Walking, standing, bending\n- Alleviating: Rest, medication, heat\n\nOpioid History:\n- Started oxycodone 3 years ago by prior PCP\n- Escalated from 5 mg TID to QID\n- Tried to increase himself once (took extra dose)\n- Withdrawal symptoms if misses dose: achiness, restlessness\n- Functional Improvement? Family says no - he's doing LESS than before\n\nSide Effects:\n- Constipation: Severe (no BM 5 days, uses laxatives)\n- Sedation: Sleepy during day\n- Cognitive: \"Foggy\" thinking, family notes confusion\n- Falls: 2 in past month (no injury, but concerning)\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Degenerative disc disease, lumbar stenosis\n- Osteoarthritis (spine, hips, knees)\n- Hypertension\n- Mild cognitive impairment\n- BPH\n- Chronic constipation\n\nMedications:\n- Oxycodone 5 mg QID\n- Lisinopril 10 mg daily\n- Tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily\n- Docusate 100 mg BID (for opioid-induced constipation)\n- Acetaminophen PRN\n\nAllergies: NSAIDs (GI bleed history)\nSocial: Widower, lives with son, retired, no alcohol, no tobacco\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Blood Pressure: 128/74 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 68 bpm\n- Weight: 165 lbs\n\nGeneral Appearance:\n- Elderly male, appears drowsy\n- Slow to respond\n- Pleasant, cooperative\n\nPhysical Examination:\n- Abdomen: Distended, mild diffuse tenderness, hypoactive bowel sounds, palpable stool\n- Neurological: Oriented to person, not date, slow mentation, no focal deficits\n- Musculoskeletal: Lumbar tenderness, limited ROM, antalgic gait\n- Gait: Unsteady, uses cane, slow, guarded\n\nCognitive:\n- MoCA: 20/30 (mild-moderate impairment, baseline was 24 per records)\n- Cognition may be worsened by opioids\n\nAbdominal X-ray: Significant fecal loading throughout colon\n\nPDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program):\n- Oxycodone 5 mg #120 filled monthly x 3 years\n- No concerning patterns (no doctor shopping, no early refills)\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Chronic Pain on Long-Term Opioid Therapy with Adverse Effects (ICD-10: G89.29, F11.20)\n\nProblems Identified:\n1. Opioid-Induced Adverse Effects:\n   - Severe constipation (fecal impaction)\n   - Sedation (daytime drowsiness)\n   - Cognitive impairment (worsened from baseline)\n   - Falls (2 in 1 month, high risk)\n\n2. Questionable Opioid Benefit:\n   - Still has significant pain (5-6/10 on meds)\n   - Function has DECLINED on opioids (per family)\n   - Opioid-induced hyperalgesia possible\n\n3. Opioid Use in Elderly:\n   - High-risk population\n   - Falls, fractures, cognitive impairment risks\n   - CDC/AGS guidelines: Avoid or use cautiously\n\n4. Physical Dependence (Not Same as Addiction):\n   - Withdrawal symptoms if dose missed\n   - Expected with long-term use\n   - Requires slow taper to avoid withdrawal\n\n5. Underlying Pain:\n   - Degenerative spine disease, osteoarthritis\n   - Chronic, will require multimodal management\n\n### Plan\nImmediate: Treat Constipation:\n\n1. Bowel regimen intensification:\n   - Polyethylene glycol (Miralax) 17 g BID until bowel movement\n   - Bisacodyl 10 mg suppository today\n   - May need enema if no response\n   - Once resolved: Daily Miralax + senna maintenance\n\n2. Consider peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (if still on opioids):\n   - Methylnaltrexone or naloxegol for opioid-induced constipation\n   - Can use if other laxatives insufficient\n\nOpioid Taper Plan (Gradual, Safe):\n\n3. Goals of Taper:\n   - Reduce adverse effects (sedation, falls, constipation, cognition)\n   - Improve function and quality of life\n   - NOT to eliminate pain completely (unrealistic goal)\n   - Pain may actually improve with taper (hyperalgesia resolves)\n\n4. Taper Schedule:\n   - Current: Oxycodone 5 mg QID (20 mg/day)\n   - Week 1-2: 5 mg TID + 2.5 mg at HS (17.5 mg/day)\n   - Week 3-4: 5 mg TID (15 mg/day)\n   - Week 5-6: 5 mg BID + 2.5 mg at HS (12.5 mg/day)\n   - Week 7-8: 5 mg BID (10 mg/day)\n   - Continue gradual reduction by 10-20% every 2-4 weeks\n   - Goal: Lowest effective dose or off completely\n   - Rate: 10% reduction every 2-4 weeks is generally safe\n\n5. Monitor for Withdrawal:\n   - Symptoms: Anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, diarrhea, myalgias, sweating\n   - If severe, slow taper rate\n   - Clonidine 0.1 mg can help withdrawal symptoms if needed\n\n6. Monitor Pain:\n   - May transiently worsen then stabilize or improve\n   - Hyperalgesia should improve with taper\n\nMultimodal Pain Management (Opioid Alternatives):\n\n7. Acetaminophen (First-Line):\n   - Scheduled dosing: 650-1000 mg TID (max 3 g/day in elderly)\n   - Safe, effective for OA pain\n   - NOT PRN - scheduled for chronic pain\n\n8. Topical Agents:\n   - Diclofenac gel (Voltaren) to knees, hips (if OA)\n     - Minimal systemic absorption, safer than oral NSAIDs\n   - Lidocaine 5% patches to back\n   - Capsaicin cream\n\n9. Oral NSAIDs: AVOID (history of GI bleed)\n\n10. Neuropathic Pain Agents:\n    - If radicular component: Trial of gabapentin or pregabalin\n    - Caution: Can cause sedation, falls (already a problem)\n    - If used, start very low dose (gabapentin 100 mg at HS)\n    - Consider topical lidocaine instead\n\n11. Duloxetine:\n    - SNRI, FDA-approved for chronic musculoskeletal pain\n    - Start 30 mg daily, increase to 60 mg\n    - Also helps mood if depression present\n    - May be good option for this patient\n\n12. Physical Therapy:\n    - Essential for chronic pain management\n    - Strengthening, flexibility, aerobic conditioning\n    - Improves function, reduces pain\n    - Referral to PT with geriatric experience\n\n13. Heat Therapy:\n    - Heating pad, warm baths\n    - Patient already finds this helpful\n\n14. Spinal Interventions (If Appropriate):\n    - Epidural steroid injections for stenosis/radiculopathy\n    - Facet joint injections if facet arthropathy\n    - Pain management referral for evaluation\n\n15. Acupuncture, Massage:\n    - Some evidence for chronic pain\n    - Patient preference\n\n16. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Pain:\n    - Pain psychology referral\n    - Pain coping strategies\n    - Effective even in elderly\n\n17. Mindfulness, Relaxation Techniques:\n    - May help with pain perception\n\nSafety - Fall Prevention:\n\n18. High fall risk on opioids - another reason to taper\n19. PT for balance and strength training\n20. Home safety evaluation\n21. Remove throw rugs, improve lighting\n22. Assistive device evaluation (cane appropriate?)\n23. Personal emergency response device (lives with son but still useful)\n\nCognitive Monitoring:\n\n24. MoCA declined (24 \u2192 20) - opioids likely contributing\n25.

Acknowledge her sacrifice and difficulty:\n   - \"What you're doing is incredibly hard\"\n   - \"Caregiver burnout is real and common\"\n   - \"Taking care of yourself is not selfish - it's necessary\"\n\n2. Normalize her feelings:\n   - Guilt, resentment, frustration are normal\n   - Doesn't mean she doesn't love her husband\n   - Many caregivers feel this way\n\nMedical Treatment:\n\n3. Depression and Anxiety Treatment:\n   - Start SSRI: Sertraline 25 mg daily, increase to 50 mg after 1 week\n   - Or escitalopram 5 mg daily, increase to 10 mg\n   - May take 4-6 weeks for full effect\n   - Also helps with anxiety\n\n4.

Sleep:\n   - Sleep deprivation is severe - contributing to all symptoms\n   - MUST address nighttime care for husband (see respite below)\n   - Melatonin 3-5 mg at HS\n   - Sleep hygiene (when able)\n\n6. Blood Pressure:\n   - Elevated today (148/92) - stress-related\n   - May need to increase lisinopril to 20 mg\n   - Recheck after stress interventions started\n\n7. Nutrition:\n   - Weight loss concerning\n   - Encourage regular meals\n   - Easy, quick nutrition options\n   - Consider meal delivery service\n\nRespite Care (CRITICAL):\n\n8. Respite care is essential - she cannot continue 24/7 alone:\n   - In-home respite: Hire aide to come several hours daily or weekly\n   - Adult day programs: Husband attends during day, she gets break\n   - Overnight respite: Some facilities offer short stays for dementia patients\n\n9. Resources for Respite:\n   - Medicare: May cover some home health if medical need documented\n   - Medicaid: If income-eligible, covers more extensive services\n   - VA: If husband is veteran, may have VA benefits\n   - Alzheimer's Association: Local chapter has respite resources\n   - Area Agency on Aging: Call for local services\n   - Private pay: If affordable, hire aide through home care agency\n\n10. Social Work Referral:\n    - For comprehensive assessment of available services\n    - Help navigating insurance, Medicaid, community resources\n    - Financial counseling for care needs\n\nSupport Groups:\n\n11.

Engage daughter more:\n    - Family meeting to discuss care plan\n    - Daughter can help from afar (research resources, finances, phone support)\n    - Regular respite visits from daughter\n    - Siblings, if any, should share burden\n\n14. Honest conversation about long-term:\n    - Is 24/7 home care sustainable?\n    - At what point is facility care needed?\n    - Planning ahead reduces crisis decisions\n\nHusband's Care:\n\n15. Review husband's dementia care:\n    - Is he seeing his doctor regularly?\n    - Medications optimized (donepezil, memantine)?\n    - Behavioral interventions for wandering, outbursts?\n    - May need higher level of care eventually\n\n16. If husband's behaviors worsening:\n    - Geriatric psychiatry referral for behavior management\n    - May reduce caregiver burden if behaviors controlled\n\nSafety:\n\n17. Husband's safety:\n    - Wandering is a safety risk\n    - Door alarms, GPS tracker\n    - Safe Return program (Alzheimer's Association)\n    - May need facility with secured unit if wandering severe\n\n18. Her safety:\n    - If she becomes ill, who cares for husband?\n    - Emergency plan needed\n    - Respite/backup plan for emergencies\n\nSelf-Care Prescription:\n\n19. Permission to take care of herself:\n    - \"I'm prescribing self-care: You must do something for yourself every week\"\n    - Even 30 minutes to herself daily\n    - Resume one enjoyable activity (gardening, reading)\n    - She cannot pour from an empty cup\n\n20. Physical activity:\n    - Even short walks help mood, stress\n    - Encourage daily movement\n\n21. Social reconnection:\n    - Call one friend this week\n    - Accept help when offered\n\nFuture Planning:\n\n22. Advance Care Planning for Husband:\n    - Does he have advance directive, healthcare proxy?\n    - What are his wishes (expressed before dementia worsened)?\n    - Discuss goals of care with family\n\n23. Consider facility placement discussion:\n    - Not a failure - appropriate at some point for many\n    - Memory care units specialize in dementia\n    - May improve quality of life for BOTH patient and caregiver\n    - Can visit daily, be wife instead of nurse\n\n24. This is a process - not immediate decision\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n25. Close follow-up for her:\n    - Return in 2-3 weeks to assess mood, medication response\n    - Phone check-in at 1 week\n    - Can she bring someone to appointment (for support)?\n\n26. Social work follow-up: Ensure resources connected\n27. Counseling referral: Schedule initial appointment\n28. Support group: Provide local Alzheimer's Association number\n\nPatient Education:\n\n29. Provided written resources:\n    - Alzheimer's Association: 1-800-272-3900, alz.org\n    - Area Agency on Aging: Local number\n    - Caregiver Action Network: caregiveraction.org\n    - Respite care locator\n\n30. Warning signs to return:\n    - Suicidal thoughts\n    - Inability to function\n    - Physical symptoms worsening\n    - If she feels unable to continue caregiving safely\n\n31.

Independence can be maintained:\n    - Driving is one form of transportation, not only one\n    - Goal: Keep him mobile and engaged safely\n\nLegal/Regulatory Considerations:\n\n15. State Reporting Requirements:\n    - Some states require physician reporting of unsafe drivers\n    - Some states allow voluntary reporting\n    - Check state-specific regulations\n    - DMV can request re-testing\n\n16. Document Discussion:\n    - Documented concerns, recommendations, and patient discussion\n    - If patient continues driving against advice, document\n    - Consider liability issues\n\n17. If Patient Refuses to Stop Driving Despite Recommendation:\n    - Report to DMV (may be required by state law)\n    - Consider involving family more directly\n    - Document clearly\n    - Notify insurance company (family may choose to)\n\nSafety Measures (Interim):\n\n18. If patient continues driving before evaluation:\n    - Only short, familiar routes in daytime\n    - Never drive alone - always have passenger\n    - Avoid highways, heavy traffic, bad weather\n    - Family monitors closely\n\n19. If signs of danger:\n    - Family may need to take keys or disable car\n    - This is last resort but may be necessary for safety\n\nEmotional Support:\n\n20. Loss of driving is significant loss for elderly:\n    - Loss of independence\n    - Loss of identity (\"I've been a driver for 60 years\")\n    - May lead to depression, isolation\n\n21. Address grief and adjustment:\n    - Validate feelings\n    - Counseling if needed\n    - Focus on maintaining engagement and mobility other ways\n\nDementia Management:\n\n22. Continue donepezil 10 mg\n23. Regular follow-up for dementia progression\n24. If dementia worsens: Driving cessation will eventually be necessary\n25. Early planning makes transition easier\n\nVision Management:\n\n26. Ophthalmology for AMD follow-up\n27. Optimize visual aids\n28. If vision below legal limit: DMV notification may be required\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n29. Driving evaluation: Schedule ASAP\n30. Return to discuss results: 2-4 weeks after evaluation\n31. Decision based on objective findings\n32. Support patient and family through outcome\n33. PCP follow-up for dementia and overall care\n\nDocumentation:\n\n34. Documented:\n    - Concerns about driving safety\n    - Cognitive testing results\n    - Discussion with patient and family\n    - Recommendations (evaluation, interim restrictions)\n    - Patient understanding and plan\n\n35. This protects patient, public, and physician"

MEDICATIONS (Most Likely Culprit):\n   - Diphenhydramine: Anticholinergic (HIGH risk for delirium) - NEW\n   - Oxybutynin: Anticholinergic (cumulative effect)\n   - Zolpidem: Sedative-hypnotic\n   - Tramadol: Opioid, serotonergic (delirium risk)\n   - Lorazepam: Benzodiazepine\n\n2. Dehydration/poor intake\n3. Mild hyponatremia (132)\n4. Possible constipation/urinary retention (oxybutynin can cause)\n5. Sleep disturbance\n\nAnticholinergic Burden: Very High\n- Diphenhydramine + Oxybutynin = significant anticholinergic load\n\n### Plan\nDELIRIUM WORKUP COMPLETE - Focus on Precipitants:\n\n1. Medication Review and Deprescribing (CRITICAL):\n\n   a) STOP Diphenhydramine:\n      - Strong anticholinergic, Beers Criteria inappropriate\n      - Most likely precipitant (new medication)\n\n   b) STOP Oxybutynin:\n      - Strong anticholinergic, avoid in elderly\n      - Alternative if needed: Mirabegron (beta-3 agonist, non-anticholinergic)\n\n   c) STOP Zolpidem:\n      - Beers Criteria inappropriate in elderly\n      - Increases fall risk, confusion\n\n   d) Minimize Tramadol:\n      - Use acetaminophen first-line for pain\n      - Opioids contribute to delirium\n\n   e) Review Lorazepam:\n      - PRN is okay for acute agitation if needed\n      - But benzodiazepines generally worsen delirium\n\n2. Correct Metabolic Abnormalities:\n   - Hyponatremia 132: Likely hypovolemic, give fluids\n   - IV fluids: NS maintenance, encourage oral intake\n   - Recheck sodium in 24 hours\n\n3. Rule Out Infection:\n   - UTI less likely (negative nitrites, minimal WBCs)\n   - Follow urine culture\n   - No evidence of pneumonia or other infection\n\n4. Check for Urinary Retention:\n   - Bladder scan (anticholinergics can cause retention)\n   - If retention: Straight cath\n\n5. Check for Constipation:\n   - Fecal impaction can cause delirium\n   - Disimpact if needed, bowel regimen\n\nNON-PHARMACOLOGIC DELIRIUM MANAGEMENT (First-Line):\n\n6. Reorientation:\n   - Frequent reorientation (date, time, place)\n   - Clock and calendar in room\n   - Family photos\n   - Familiar objects from home\n\n7. Sleep hygiene:\n   - Maintain day-night cycle\n   - Daytime: Keep lights on, curtains open, engage patient\n   - Nighttime: Dim lights, minimize interruptions, quiet\n   - Avoid sedatives for sleep (worsen delirium)\n\n8. Sensory aids:\n   - Ensure glasses and hearing aids are available and used\n   - Clear communication\n\n9. Mobility:\n   - Early mobilization (sit in chair, walk with assistance)\n   - Avoid physical restraints (worsen delirium)\n\n10. Hydration and nutrition:\n    - Encourage oral intake\n    - Assist with meals\n\n11. Family presence:\n    - Encourage family to stay and provide reassurance\n    - Familiar faces reduce agitation\n\nPHARMACOLOGIC MANAGEMENT OF AGITATION (Only if severe):\n\n12. Avoid medications if possible - non-pharmacologic first\n\n13. If severely agitated, endangering self or others:\n    - Antipsychotics (low dose, short-term):\n      - Haloperidol 0.5-1 mg PO/IM (avoid in Parkinsonism, prolonged QT)\n      - Risperidone 0.25-0.5 mg PO\n      - Quetiapine 12.5-25 mg PO (less EPS, safer in Parkinsonism)\n    - Use lowest effective dose, shortest duration\n    - Not for hypoactive delirium\n\n14. Avoid benzodiazepines (worsen confusion) except:\n    - Alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal\n    - Seizures\n    - Parkinson's disease (can't use antipsychotics)\n\nMONITORING:\n\n15. Serial cognitive assessments (CAM daily)\n16. Monitor for resolution after offending medications stopped\n17. Vital signs, I/Os\n18. Fall precautions\n\nDELIRIUM PROGNOSIS:\n\n19. Delirium in elderly:\n    - Associated with increased mortality\n    - Prolonged hospitalization\n    - Functional decline\n    - May not fully recover (persistent cognitive decline)\n\n20. Early recognition and treatment improves outcomes\n\nPREVENT FUTURE EPISODES:\n\n21. Deprescribing inappropriate medications\n22. Avoid anticholinergics, sedative-hypnotics, opioids if possible\n23. Use Beers Criteria to guide prescribing in elderly\n24. Medication reconciliation at every visit\n\nFAMILY DISCUSSION:\n\n25. Explain delirium (acute confusion, reversible, different from dementia)\n26. Medications are likely cause\n27. May take days to weeks to resolve after stopping offending meds\n28. Family involvement in reorientation is helpful\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n\n29. Re-assess daily during hospitalization\n30. Geriatrics consultation if complex\n31. PCP follow-up within 1 week of discharge\n32. Cognitive reassessment in 4-6 weeks (ensure return to baseline)"

Fall Prevention:\n\n   a) Physical therapy referral:\n      - Strength training\n      - Balance exercises\n      - Gait training\n      \n   b) Home safety evaluation:\n      - Remove throw rugs\n      - Install grab bars (bathroom)\n      - Adequate lighting\n      \n   c) Assistive device: Rolling walker or cane\n   \n   d) Review medications for fall risk (sedatives, antihypertensives)\n   \n   e) Vitamin D supplementation (reduces falls)\n   \n   f) Vision and hearing evaluation\n\n5. Functional Support:\n\n   a) Occupational therapy evaluation\n   \n   b) Home health services:\n      - Home health aide for ADL assistance\n      - Visiting nurse for monitoring\n      \n   c) Meals on Wheels or meal delivery service\n   \n   d) Adult day program consideration (socialization, supervision)\n\n6. Social Support:\n\n   a) Social work consultation:\n      - Assess home safety\n      - Caregiver support\n      - Financial resources\n      - Long-term care planning\n      \n   b) Reduce isolation:\n      - Senior center activities\n      - Faith community connections\n      - Family involvement\n      \n   c) Son involvement: Discuss increased supervision needs\n   \n   d) Living situation:\n      - May need higher level of care (assisted living, family caregiver)\n      - Discuss with family\n\n7. Malignancy Screen (Weight Loss Workup):\n\n   a) Age-appropriate cancer screening:\n      - Colonoscopy (if not recent and life expectancy >10 years)\n      - Consider CT chest/abdomen/pelvis if high suspicion\n      \n   b) PSA: Normal\n   c) Chest X-ray: Normal\n   d) Anemia workup: Iron studies, reticulocyte count\n\n8. Medication Review:\n\n   a) Assess for polypharmacy/inappropriate medications\n   b) Simplify regimen if possible\n   c) Ensure all medications have clear indication\n   d) Check for drug-drug interactions\n\n9. Advance Care Planning:\n\n   a) Given frailty and functional decline:\n      - Discuss goals of care with patient and son\n      - Advance directives, healthcare proxy\n      - Code status discussion\n      \n   b) Geriatric consult may assist with prognostication\n\n10. Driving Safety:\n    - With cognitive impairment, assess driving safety\n    - May need formal driving evaluation\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n\n11. Geriatrics consult for comprehensive assessment\n12. Follow-up in 2-4 weeks to assess interventions\n13. Recheck weight, nutritional markers\n14. Reassess mood on antidepressant\n15. Physical therapy progress\n16. Home services in place"

Immobility (bedbound)\n2. Malnutrition (albumin 2.4, prealbumin 10)\n3. Incontinence (urinary and fecal - moisture damage)\n4. Sensory impairment (dementia, cannot report discomfort)\n5. Advanced age, thin skin\n6. Diabetes (impairs wound healing)\n7. Inadequate repositioning (staffing issues)\n\nWound Healing Prognosis:\n- POOR given comorbidities\n- Goals should be realistic: prevention of worsening, comfort, infection prevention\n- Complete healing unlikely in this clinical context\n\n### Plan\nWOUND CARE FOR STAGE 3 SACRAL PRESSURE ULCER:\n\n1. Wound Bed Preparation (TIME Principles):\n\n   a) Tissue management - Debridement:\n      - Autolytic debridement preferred (gentle, for slough)\n      - Hydrogel to sloughy areas to promote autolysis\n      - Sharp debridement if significant necrotic tissue (by wound specialist)\n      - AVOID aggressive debridement in comfort-focused patient\n\n   b) Infection/Inflammation control:\n      - Monitor for clinical signs of infection:\n        - Increased pain, warmth, erythema, purulence, odor\n        - Wound not progressing\n      - If infection suspected: wound culture, consider topical antimicrobial\n      - Systemic antibiotics only for cellulitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis\n\n   c) Moisture balance:\n      - Keep wound bed moist but not macerated\n      - Foam dressing appropriate (absorbs moderate drainage, cushions)\n\n   d) Edge advancement:\n      - Protect wound edges from trauma\n      - Manage undermining (pack loosely if needed)\n\n2. Dressing Recommendations (Stage 3 with moderate drainage):\n\n   Primary Dressing:\n   - Hydrocolloid or hydrogel for slough areas\n   - Alginate or hydrofiber if heavy drainage\n\n   Secondary Dressing:\n   - Foam dressing (bordered, sacral-shaped)\n     - Examples: Mepilex Sacral, Allevyn Sacral\n   - Change every 2-3 days or if soiled/saturated\n\n   Alternative:\n   - Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (wound VAC) if healing is goal\n   - However, in comfort-focused care, may not be appropriate\n\n3. Offloading and Pressure Redistribution (CRITICAL):\n\n   a) Pressure-redistribution mattress:\n      - Low-air-loss mattress or alternating pressure mattress\n      - Medicare will cover for Stage 3-4 ulcers (Group 2 support surface)\n\n   b) Repositioning schedule:\n      - Turn every 2 hours (minimum)\n      - 30-degree lateral positioning (avoid 90-degree side-lying)\n      - Use pillows, wedges to offload sacrum\n      - Floating heels (pillow under calves)\n\n   c) Avoid head of bed elevation >30 degrees (shear force on sacrum)\n\n   d) Lift, don't drag patient (reduce shear and friction)\n\n4. Nutrition Optimization (Essential for wound healing):\n\n   a) Increase protein intake:\n      - High-protein diet: 1.25-1.5 g/kg/day\n      - Protein supplements (e.g., Boost High Protein, Ensure Plus)\n      - If not meeting goals orally, consider tube feeding (discuss with family given goals of care)\n\n   b) Caloric needs: 30-35 kcal/kg/day for wound healing\n\n   c) Vitamin supplementation:\n      - Vitamin C 500 mg BID (collagen synthesis)\n      - Zinc 220 mg daily (wound healing)\n      - Multivitamin with minerals\n\n   d) Hydration: Adequate fluids\n\n   e) Registered Dietitian consultation\n\n5. Incontinence Management:\n\n   a) Fecal incontinence:\n      - Barrier cream (zinc oxide, dimethicone) to periwound skin\n      - Fecal management system if severe diarrhea\n      - Maintain skin integrity\n\n   b) Urinary incontinence:\n      - Foley catheter in place (appropriate for wound healing)\n      - Monitor for CAUTI\n\n6. Heel Pressure Ulcer Management:\n\n   a) Right heel (Stage 2):\n      - Offload with heel suspension boots (Prevalon boots) or pillows\n      - Hydrocolloid or foam dressing\n\n   b) Left heel (Stage 1):\n      - Same offloading measures\n      - Transparent dressing or barrier cream\n\n7. Pain Management:\n\n   a) Pre-medicate before dressing changes:\n      - Acetaminophen 650 mg 30 min before\n      - Topical lidocaine to wound if needed\n\n   b) Gentle wound care technique\n\n8. Glycemic Control:\n   - Optimize diabetes management\n   - HbA1c 7.5% is acceptable for elderly with limited life expectancy\n   - Avoid hypoglycemia (more dangerous than mild hyperglycemia in this patient)\n\n9. Wound Specialist Referral:\n   - Consider wound care nurse or physician consultation\n   - Surgical consult NOT indicated (comfort care, poor surgical candidate)\n\n10. Monitoring:\n    - Weekly wound measurements (length, width, depth)\n    - Photograph weekly for documentation\n    - Document wound bed appearance, drainage, periwound condition\n    - Monitor for infection\n\n11. Goals of Care Discussion:\n\n    a) Given DNR/DNI status, comfort-focused approach:\n       - Goals: Comfort, prevent infection, prevent worsening\n       - Complete healing is unlikely and may not be realistic goal\n       - Avoid burdensome interventions (e.g., surgery, wound VAC may not be appropriate)\n\n    b) Family meeting to discuss:\n       - Prognosis\n       - Realistic wound healing expectations\n       - Comfort measures\n       - Hospice evaluation if appropriate\n\n12. Nursing Home Communication:\n    - Pressure ulcer documentation and staging\n    - Repositioning schedule compliance\n    - Nutritional supplementation\n    - Dressing change protocol\n    - Signs of infection to report\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n13. Wound check in 2 weeks\n14. Nutritional status reassessment\n15. Adjust plan based on wound progression"

COGNITIVE DECLINE:\n   - Anticholinergic burden\n   - Sedatives\n   - May be medication-induced rather than dementia\n\n### Plan\nDEPRESCRIBING PLAN (Prioritized):\n\n**STOP IMMEDIATELY (High Priority):**\n\n1. STOP Diphenhydramine:\n   - Beers Criteria: AVOID in elderly\n   - Strong anticholinergic\n   - Causes confusion, falls, constipation\n   - Not effective for chronic insomnia\n   - Patient likely habituated\n\n2. TAPER Zolpidem:\n   - Beers Criteria: AVOID in elderly\n   - High fall risk, cognitive impairment\n   - Taper: 10 mg \u2192 5 mg x 1 week \u2192 2.5 mg x 1 week \u2192 stop\n   - Implement sleep hygiene\n\n3. TAPER Lorazepam (SLOWLY):\n   - Beers Criteria: AVOID in elderly\n   - High fall risk, cognitive impairment\n   - MUST taper slowly (long-term use)\n   - Taper: 1 mg BID \u2192 0.5 mg BID x 2 weeks \u2192 0.5 mg daily x 2 weeks \u2192 0.25 mg daily x 2 weeks \u2192 stop\n   - Withdrawal symptoms possible - monitor\n\n4. STOP Oxybutynin:\n   - Strong anticholinergic, Beers Criteria\n   - Causes confusion, dry mouth, constipation\n   - Alternative if OAB persists: Mirabegron 25 mg daily (beta-3, non-anticholinergic)\n\n**REDUCE/STOP (Medium Priority):**\n\n5. STOP Glipizide:\n   - HbA1c 6.2% = over-treated\n   - Sulfonylurea = hypoglycemia risk (dangerous in elderly)\n   - Continue Metformin alone\n   - Target HbA1c: 7-8% in this patient\n   - Less strict control safer than hypoglycemia\n\n6. REDUCE Gabapentin:\n   - 1800 mg/day is high for elderly\n   - Reduce to 300 mg TID (900 mg/day)\n   - Causes sedation, ataxia, fall risk\n\n7. REDUCE/STOP Tramadol:\n   - Opioid - fall risk, constipation, sedation\n   - Try non-opioid: Acetaminophen 650 mg QID\n   - Taper: 50 mg QID \u2192 50 mg TID \u2192 50 mg BID \u2192 stop\n   - Consider topical diclofenac for localized pain\n\n**ADJUST BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATIONS:**\n\n8. Reduce Antihypertensives (causing orthostatic hypotension):\n\n   a) Reduce Amlodipine: 10 mg \u2192 5 mg\n      - Contributing to orthostatic hypotension\n\n   b) Reduce Metoprolol: 100 mg \u2192 50 mg\n      - HR 58 is too low\n      - Need some beta-blockade for A-fib rate control\n\n   c) Furosemide: Consider stopping if edema mild\n      - Contributes to orthostatic hypotension, hypokalemia\n      - Reassess need\n\n   d) Lisinopril: Keep at 20 mg for now (renoprotective in DM)\n      - May reduce later if BP too low\n\n   Target: BP 140-150/80-90 is acceptable in frail elderly (not 120/80)\n\n**CONTINUE APPROPRIATELY:**\n\n9. Continue Warfarin: Indicated for A-fib (unless falls become excessive)\n   - INR 2.8 - slightly high, adjust dose to 4.5 mg\n   - Consider direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) if stable (less monitoring)\n\n10. Continue Metformin 1000 mg BID:\n    - Good choice in DM, low hypoglycemia risk\n    - Monitor renal function\n\n11. Continue Atorvastatin 40 mg:\n    - For secondary prevention if history of CVD\n    - May consider stopping if primary prevention only and limited life expectancy\n\n12.

Possible medication-related (donepezil can cause agitation in some)\n5. Unmet needs (hunger, thirst, discomfort)\n6. Environmental (overstimulation or understimulation)\n7. Caregiver stress (patient senses caregiver distress)\n\nDementia Stage: Severe/Advanced (GDS 7, FAST Stage 7)\n\n### Plan\nBPSD MANAGEMENT - STEPWISE APPROACH:\n\n**STEP 1: TREAT UNDERLYING CAUSES (Always First)**\n\n1. Treat UTI:\n   - Ciprofloxacin 250 mg BID x 5 days (or Nitrofurantoin 100 mg BID if able to swallow)\n   - UTI is common cause of delirium/behavioral change in dementia\n   - May see improvement in 2-3 days\n\n2. Treat Constipation:\n   - Disimpaction if needed\n   - Polyethylene glycol (Miralax) 17 g daily\n   - Docusate 100 mg BID\n   - High-fiber diet if tolerating oral intake\n   - Constipation causes significant discomfort\n\n3. Treat Pain (Often unrecognized in dementia):\n   - Scheduled acetaminophen 650 mg TID (not PRN)\n   - Dementia patients cannot request pain medication\n   - Empiric pain treatment often reduces agitation\n   - Consider topical diclofenac for arthritis\n   - Avoid opioids if possible (delirium)\n\n4. Reassess after treating above:\n   - Behavioral symptoms may improve significantly\n   - If resolved, no need for psychotropics\n\n**STEP 2: NON-PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS (First-Line)**\n\n5. Environmental Modifications:\n   - Consistent daily routine\n   - Calm, quiet environment (reduce noise, chaos)\n   - Adequate lighting (prevent sundowning)\n   - Night lights (reduce disorientation)\n   - Remove mirrors (may cause confusion)\n   - Secure exit doors (wandering safety)\n   - GPS tracker or door alarms\n\n6. Approach and Communication:\n   - Approach slowly, from front (not behind)\n   - Calm, reassuring voice\n   - Simple, one-step commands\n   - Don't argue or correct (therapeutic fibbing okay)\n   - Distraction and redirection (more effective than confrontation)\n   - Validate emotions\n\n7. Structured Activities:\n   - Music therapy (familiar songs from patient's era)\n   - Gentle exercise/movement\n   - Sensory stimulation (tactile objects)\n   - Pet therapy\n   - Art, reminiscence therapy\n\n8. Bathing/Care Strategies (Aggression often during care):\n   - Warm bathroom, warm towels\n   - Cover body parts not being washed (preserves dignity)\n   - Sing or play music during bath\n   - Bed bath or sponge bath if shower/tub causes distress\n   - Schedule care at patient's best time of day (not sundowning hours)\n\n9. Sleep Hygiene (Day-night reversal):\n   - Daytime: Keep active, bright light exposure\n   - Evening: Dim lights, calm activities\n   - Limit daytime napping\n   - Avoid caffeine\n\n10. Wandering Management:\n    - Safe wandering path indoors\n    - Secure environment (locks, alarms)\n    - Identification bracelet\n    - Address underlying cause (looking for something, restlessness)\n\n**STEP 3: PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS (If non-pharmacologic fails)**\n\n11. Avoid medications if possible - black box warnings in dementia\n\n12. If necessary, use lowest dose, shortest duration:\n\n    For Agitation/Aggression:\n    \n    a) First-line options:\n       - SSRI: Citalopram 10 mg daily (max 20 mg in elderly)\n         - Evidence for agitation in dementia (CitAD trial)\n         - Takes 2-4 weeks for effect\n         - Watch QTc prolongation\n       \n       - Trazodone 25 mg BID-TID (especially for sleep)\n         - Sedating, helps agitation and sleep\n         - Low side effect profile\n\n    b) Second-line (antipsychotics) - USE WITH CAUTION:\n       - BLACK BOX WARNING: Increased mortality in elderly with dementia\n       - Use only if severe symptoms, danger to self or others\n       - Risperidone 0.25-0.5 mg BID (most evidence in BPSD)\n       - Quetiapine 12.5-25 mg BID (less EPS, good for nighttime)\n       - Haloperidol: Avoid in elderly (EPS, QTc) unless very short-term\n       - Use lowest effective dose, shortest duration\n       - Try to taper off after 3 months\n\n    c) Avoid:\n       - Benzodiazepines (worsen confusion, paradoxical agitation)\n       - Diphenhydramine (anticholinergic, worsens dementia)\n\n13. Consider stopping Donepezil:\n    - In advanced dementia, benefit is minimal\n    - Can cause agitation, insomnia, vivid dreams in some patients\n    - Trial off (taper over 2 weeks) and observe\n    - If no worsening or improvement in agitation, discontinue\n\n**STEP 4: CAREGIVER SUPPORT (Critical)**\n\n14. Address Caregiver Burnout:\n    - Caregiver support groups\n    - Respite care (in-home or adult day programs)\n    - Home health aide for ADL assistance\n    - Family meeting to share caregiving responsibilities\n\n15. Caregiver Education:\n    - BPSD is part of dementia, not intentional\n    - Techniques for redirection, de-escalation\n    - Self-care for caregiver\n    - When to seek help\n\n16. Adult Day Program:\n    - Provides structured activities\n    - Socialization\n    - Gives caregiver daytime break\n\n17. Long-term Care Discussion:\n    - If caregiver cannot manage, nursing home may be necessary\n    - No guilt - advanced dementia care is difficult\n    - Specialty dementia care units available\n\n**STEP 5: ADVANCE CARE PLANNING**\n\n18. Goals of Care:\n    - DNR/DNI in place\n    - Discuss comfort-focused care\n    - Feeding: If stops eating, discuss hand feeding vs. tube feeding (tube feeding not recommended in advanced dementia)\n    - Hospitalization: Discuss whether to hospitalize for future illnesses\n\n19. Palliative Care/Hospice:\n    - Advanced dementia is a terminal illness\n    - Hospice eligibility: FAST stage 7C, recurrent infections, weight loss\n    - Hospice provides comfort care, support for family\n    - Discuss with family when appropriate\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n20. Phone check in 3-5 days (after UTI treatment, assess improvement)\n21. Office visit in 2 weeks to reassess behaviors\n22. Caregiver support resources provided\n23. Safety plan for wandering"

STOP Tramadol (opioid, CNS depression, falls)\n12. Continue Tylenol scheduled: 1000mg TID (max 3g/day in elderly)\n13. Topical diclofenac for joint pain\n14. PT for pain management\n\nOther Adjustments:\n15. REDUCE Omeprazole to 20mg, plan to discontinue if no clear indication\n16. Continue Aspirin only if clear cardiovascular indication\n\nSupplementation:\n17. Vitamin D 2000 IU daily\n18. B12 1000mcg daily\n\nFall Prevention:\n19. Home safety evaluation (PT/OT)\n20. Remove throw rugs, improve lighting\n21. Bedside commode for nocturia\n22. Physical therapy for strength and balance\n\nCognitive Monitoring:\n23. Repeat cognitive testing in 3 months after deprescribing\n24. Anticholinergic burden may be causing reversible cognitive impairment\n25. If persistent, dementia workup\n\nCommunication:\n26. Notify all specialists of medication changes\n27. Single prescriber coordination if possible\n28. Updated medication list to pharmacy\n\nFollow-up:\n29. Phone check in 1 week\n30.

Patient CD4 350: No prophylaxis needed currently\n\n12. If CD4 drops <200: Start TMP-SMX DS daily\n\nVaccinations:\n\n13. Vaccinations important in HIV:\n    - Pneumococcal: PCV15 then PPSV23 (8 weeks later), or PCV20 alone\n    - Influenza: Annually\n    - Hepatitis B: Already immune (sAb positive)\n    - Hepatitis A: Check Ab, vaccinate if susceptible\n    - Tdap: If not recent\n    - HPV: If age <45 and not vaccinated\n    - COVID-19: Up to date\n    - Meningococcal: ACWY and B\n    - Zoster (Shingrix): Consider when CD4 >200 and stable on ART\n\n14. Administer: PCV15 today, schedule PPSV23 in 8 weeks\n\n15. Avoid live vaccines if CD4 <200 (MMR, varicella, zoster live)\n\nSTI Screening and Prevention:\n\n16. STI screening performed: Negative\n17. Repeat STI screening every 3-6 months if ongoing risk\n18. Discuss safe sex practices:\n    - Condom use\n    - U=U (Undetectable = Untransmittable): Once viral load undetectable, cannot transmit sexually\n    - Partner notification and testing\n\n19. PrEP for partners: Discuss with patient, offer for serodiscordant partners\n\nCoinfection Screening:\n\n20. Hepatitis B: Immune (no active infection, no need for HBV-active ART)\n21. Hepatitis C: Negative\n22. TB screening:\n    - Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or TST\n    - Order: QuantiFERON-TB Gold\n    - If positive: Latent TB treatment after ruling out active TB\n\nPsychosocial Support:\n\n23. Counseling and education provided\n24. Assess for depression, anxiety (common at diagnosis)\n25. Social work referral:\n    - Insurance navigation (Ryan White, ADAP if needed)\n    - Support groups\n    - Mental health resources\n\n26. Disclosure counseling:\n    - Who to tell, how to tell\n    - Partner notification services available\n\n27. Substance use assessment: Denies IV drugs, alcohol moderate\n\nReproductive Health:\n\n28. Counsel on:\n    - HIV and conception planning\n    - Undetectable viral load prevents transmission to partners\n    - If planning pregnancy with partner, discuss options\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n29. Return in 2-4 weeks:\n    - Assess medication tolerance\n    - Viral load (expect decline)\n    - Address questions\n\n30. Then every 3 months initially until stable, then every 6 months\n\n31. Long-term monitoring:\n    - Viral load: Should be undetectable (<50) by 6 months\n    - CD4: Should increase with suppressed viral load\n    - Screen for metabolic, renal, bone side effects annually\n\nPatient Education:\n\n32. HIV is a chronic manageable condition\n33. With consistent ART, life expectancy is near-normal\n34. Daily medication is essential\n35. Once undetectable, you cannot transmit HIV sexually (U=U)\n36. Regular follow-up is important\n37. Do not share medications, do not stop without talking to doctor"

Goals of ART:\n   - Viral Load Undetectable (<50 copies/mL) within 12-24 weeks\n   - CD4 Count Recovery (expect rise of 50-150 cells/year)\n   - Undetectable = Untransmittable (U=U) - cannot transmit to partners when suppressed\n\n6. Opportunistic Infection Prophylaxis:\n   - CD4 320 - above thresholds for prophylaxis\n   - No PCP prophylaxis needed (CD4 >200)\n   - No Toxoplasma prophylaxis needed (CD4 >100, Toxo IgG negative anyway)\n   - No MAC prophylaxis needed (CD4 >50)\n   - If CD4 drops <200: Start TMP-SMX for PCP prophylaxis\n\n7. Vaccinations:\n   - Hepatitis B: Immune \u2713\n   - Hepatitis A: Check antibody, vaccinate if not immune\n   - Pneumococcal: PCV20 or PCV15 + PPSV23\n   - Influenza: Annual\n   - Tdap: If not up to date\n   - COVID-19: Complete series + boosters\n   - HPV: 3-dose series if not previously completed (up to age 45 in HIV)\n   - Meningococcal: Quadrivalent + serogroup B\n   - Avoid live vaccines if CD4 <200 (not applicable here)\n\n8. Prevention and Transmission:\n   - Use condoms until viral suppression confirmed\n   - Once undetectable for \u22656 months: U=U (cannot transmit sexually)\n   - Partner notification:\n     - Encourage disclosure to current/recent partners\n     - Health department can assist anonymously if preferred\n   - PrEP for HIV-negative partners (until patient is suppressed)\n\n9. Partner Notification/Testing:\n   - Current partners should be tested\n   - If negative, offer PrEP until patient achieves viral suppression\n   - Past partners in window period should test\n\n10.

Substance Use Screening:\n    - No current use - counsel on risk reduction\n\n16. Legal Considerations:\n    - Disclosure laws vary by state - inform patient\n    - Employment protections (ADA)\n\nMONITORING SCHEDULE:\n\n17. Follow-up Labs:\n    - 2-4 weeks: CBC, CMP, LFTs (baseline and tolerability)\n    - 4-8 weeks: HIV viral load (expect significant decrease)\n    - 12 weeks: HIV viral load, CD4 count (goal: VL <200 or declining)\n    - 24 weeks: HIV viral load (goal: undetectable <50)\n    - Then: Every 3-6 months once stable\n\n18. CD4 Monitoring:\n    - Every 3-6 months until stable and suppressed\n    - Can decrease to annually once CD4 >500 and suppressed >2 years\n\n19. Resistance Testing:\n    - If viral load not suppressing despite adherence\n    - If viral rebound after suppression\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n20. Return visit in 2-4 weeks\n21.

Oral Vancomycin 125mg QID x 10-14 days (first-line for severe)\n   - NOT IV vancomycin (does not reach gut)\n2. Consider Fidaxomicin 200mg BID (if available - lower recurrence but expensive)\n3. Avoid anti-motility agents (loperamide contraindicated)\n\nDiscontinue Inciting Antibiotics:\n4. Review medication list - no current antibiotics\n5. Avoid unnecessary antibiotics in future if possible\n6. If antibiotics needed, avoid fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, cephalosporins (highest CDI risk)\n\nIV Fluid Resuscitation:\n7. IV crystalloid for dehydration and AKI\n8. Strict I/O monitoring\n9. Electrolyte repletion (K+, Mg2+)\n\nInfection Control:\n10. Contact isolation precautions\n11. Private room\n12. Healthcare workers: Gown, gloves, hand washing with soap (NOT alcohol gel - does not kill spores)\n13. Environmental cleaning with bleach-based disinfectant\n\nMonitoring for Deterioration:\n14. Serial abdominal exams\n15. Daily labs: CBC, BMP\n16. Watch for signs of fulminant colitis: Hypotension, ileus, megacolon, altered mental status\n17. Surgical consult if fulminant (may need colectomy)\n\nRecurrence Prevention:\n18. High recurrence rate (20-30%)\n19. Consider bezlotoxumab (monoclonal antibody) if high recurrence risk\n20. Probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii or Lactobacillus) controversial but may help\n21. If recurrence: Extended taper/pulse vancomycin or fidaxomicin\n22. If multiple recurrences: Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT)\n\nNutrition:\n23. Continue oral intake as tolerated\n24. Avoid dairy if lactose intolerant (worsens diarrhea)\n\nFollow-up:\n25. Stool frequency monitoring (should decrease by day 3-5)\n26. Do NOT repeat C. diff testing after treatment (can stay positive)\n27. ID follow-up if recurrence"

Uremic symptoms emerging (fatigue, nausea, pruritus)\n\n### Plan\nESRD Planning (Critical - eGFR <20):\n\n1. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) discussion:\n   - Patient approaching ESRD (eGFR 14, likely to need RRT soon)\n   - Options: Hemodialysis (HD), Peritoneal dialysis (PD), Kidney transplant, Conservative management\n\n2. Patient preferences discussion:\n   - Reviewed all modalities\n   - Patient interested in in-center hemodialysis initially\n   - Also interested in transplant evaluation\n\n3. Vascular access planning (for hemodialysis):\n   - Needs AV fistula creation (preferred access)\n   - Referral to vascular surgery for fistula placement\n   - Left arm preferred (preserve right for future)\n   - Fistula needs 3-6 months to mature\n   - Timing: NOW - so ready when dialysis needed\n\n4. Preserve arm veins:\n   - NO venipunctures or IVs in left arm\n   - Instruct patient to remind all providers\n   - No blood pressure in left arm\n\n5. Kidney transplant evaluation:\n   - Referral to transplant center\n   - Begin evaluation process\n   - Can be listed pre-emptively (before dialysis starts)\n   - Living donor inquiry (family, friends)\n\nDialysis Education:\n\n6. Dialysis education class for patient and family\n7. Home visit if considering home dialysis\n8. Social work referral for insurance, disability planning\n9. Discuss: What to expect, lifestyle changes, schedule\n\nAnemia Management:\n\n10. Target Hgb: 10-11.5 g/dL (avoid >13)\n11. Current Hgb 9.8 on EPO 10,000 units weekly\n12. Iron studies needed:\n    - TSAT and ferritin\n    - Iron stores often depleted in CKD\n    - Goal TSAT >30%, ferritin >200 ng/mL\n\n13. If iron deficient: IV iron (iron sucrose) before increasing EPO\n14. Adjust EPO: May increase to 12,000-15,000 units weekly if iron replete\n15. Order: Iron studies (TSAT, ferritin, serum iron)\n\nCKD-Mineral Bone Disease:\n\n16. Phosphorus 5.8 (goal <5.5 in CKD 4)\n17. PTH 320 (goal 70-110 for CKD 4, will be higher on dialysis)\n18. Calcium 8.6 (acceptable)\n\n19. Phosphorus control:\n    - Continue sevelamer 800 mg TID with meals\n    - May increase to 1600 mg TID if not controlled\n    - Dietary phosphorus restriction (<1000 mg/day)\n    - Education on high-phosphorus foods (dairy, processed foods, sodas)\n\n20. PTH management:\n    - Continue calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily\n    - May increase if PTH continues rising\n    - Avoid excessive vitamin D if calcium or phosphorus high\n\n21. Vitamin D status: Check 25-OH vitamin D, replete if low\n\nMetabolic Acidosis:\n\n22. Bicarbonate 20 (goal >22)\n23. Continue sodium bicarbonate 650 mg TID\n24. May increase to 1300 mg TID if not at goal\n25. Acidosis accelerates CKD progression and causes muscle wasting\n\nHyperkalemia:\n\n26. Potassium 5.3 (goal <5.0)\n27. Review medications: ACEi/ARB can raise K (losartan)\n    - Continue for proteinuria benefit, but monitor closely\n28. Dietary potassium restriction (<2000 mg/day)\n    - Low-potassium diet education\n    - Avoid: Bananas, oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, salt substitutes\n29. If K persistently elevated: Consider patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate\n\nBlood Pressure:\n\n30. BP 142/84 (goal <130/80 for CKD with proteinuria)\n31. Continue losartan (renoprotective in diabetic nephropathy)\n32. May add/adjust other agents\n33. Amlodipine and carvedilol continued\n34. Consider adding thiazide or loop diuretic if volume contributes\n\nDiabetes Management:\n\n35. Continue insulin regimen\n36. Avoid metformin (contraindicated eGFR <30)\n37. Avoid SGLT2 inhibitors at this stage (limited benefit eGFR <20-25)\n38. HbA1c goal: 7-8% (avoid hypoglycemia in CKD)\n\nUremic Symptoms:\n\n39. Fatigue, nausea, pruritus - early uremic symptoms\n40. Pruritus:\n    - Ensure phosphorus controlled\n    - Moisturizers\n    - Gabapentin 100 mg at bedtime (renally dosed) for uremic pruritus\n41. If symptoms worsen significantly: May need to start dialysis earlier\n\nMedications to Avoid/Adjust:\n\n42. Renally dose all medications\n43. Avoid NSAIDs (worsen CKD)\n44. Avoid gadolinium contrast (NSF risk) unless absolutely necessary\n45. Minimize IV contrast (AKI risk) - if needed, hydrate\n46. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs\n\nDiet:\n\n47. Renal diet:\n    - Low sodium (<2000 mg/day)\n    - Low potassium (<2000 mg/day)\n    - Low phosphorus (<1000 mg/day)\n    - Moderate protein (0.8 g/kg/day pre-dialysis)\n    - Fluid restriction if volume overloaded\n48. Dietitian referral for CKD diet education\n\nVaccinations:\n\n49. Hepatitis B vaccine: Check HBsAb\n    - If non-immune: Give HBV vaccine series (high-dose for dialysis patients)\n    - Important before dialysis\n50. Flu and pneumococcal vaccines up to date\n51. COVID-19 vaccine up to date\n\nAdvance Care Planning:\n\n52. Discuss goals of care\n53. Consider advance directive completion\n54. Conservative management option discussed (if patient ever declines dialysis)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n55. Nephrology: Every 4-6 weeks given declining function\n56. Vascular surgery: For fistula creation (URGENT)\n57. Transplant center: Evaluation referral\n58. Labs: CMP, CBC, PTH, iron studies in 4 weeks\n59. Dialysis education class scheduled\n60. Social work appointment for planning\n\nPatient Education:\n\n61. Kidneys declining, will need dialysis likely within 6-12 months\n62. Fistula surgery planned to prepare for dialysis\n63. Transplant evaluation also starting\n64. Diet and medication adherence important\n65. Report worsening symptoms: Swelling, shortness of breath, confusion, severe nausea"

Volume depletion (diarrhea, poor oral intake)\n2. NSAID use (ibuprofen) - impairs renal autoregulation\n3. ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) - contributes to decreased GFR in hypovolemia\n\nEvidence for prerenal:\n- BUN/Cr ratio >20:1 \u2713\n- FeNa <1% \u2713\n- Concentrated urine (Sp gravity 1.035) \u2713\n- Clinical hypovolemia \u2713\n- Bland urine sediment (no intrinsic renal disease) \u2713\n\n### Plan\nImmediate Management:\n\n1. STOP NEPHROTOXIC MEDICATIONS:\n   - STOP ibuprofen (NSAIDs) immediately\n   - HOLD lisinopril (ACE inhibitor) until creatinine improves\n   - These medications impair renal compensation in hypovolemia\n\n2. IV Fluid Resuscitation:\n   - Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) 1 liter bolus\n   - Then NS at 125-150 mL/hour\n   - Goal: Restore intravascular volume\n   - Monitor urine output\n\n3. Oral hydration:\n   - Encourage oral fluids as tolerated\n   - Clear liquids, oral rehydration solutions\n\n4. Foley catheter:\n   - Consider for accurate urine output monitoring if not making urine\n   - Or can monitor clinically with strict I/Os\n\n5. Urine output monitoring:\n   - Goal: >0.5 mL/kg/hour\n   - Oliguria (<400 mL/day) concerning for more severe AKI\n\nMonitoring:\n\n6. Repeat labs in 24-48 hours:\n   - BMP (creatinine, potassium, bicarbonate)\n   - Expect creatinine to improve with volume repletion\n   - If not improving: Consider intrinsic or obstructive causes\n\n7. Monitor potassium:\n   - K+ 5.1 - mildly elevated (related to AKI + ACE-i)\n   - Should improve with volume and stopping lisinopril\n   - If K+ rises >5.5: Kayexalate, consider dialysis if severe\n\n8. Monitor for fluid overload:\n   - IV fluids can cause pulmonary edema if oliguric AKI progresses\n   - Listen for crackles, check for edema\n   - Adjust fluids based on response\n\nFurther Workup (If Not Responding):\n\n9. Renal ultrasound:\n   - Rule out obstruction (hydronephrosis)\n   - Order if: No response to fluids, unclear diagnosis\n   - Order NOW if any suspicion of obstruction\n\n10. If creatinine not improving in 48-72 hours:\n    - Consider intrinsic AKI (ATN, interstitial nephritis)\n    - Repeat urine sediment analysis (look for muddy brown casts in ATN)\n    - FeNa may be >2% in ATN\n    - Consider nephrology consult\n\nMedication Management:\n\n11. Avoid all NSAIDs (OTC or prescription)\n12. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs: Aminoglycosides, IV contrast (if possible)\n13. Renally adjust all medications based on current eGFR\n14. Hold metformin if patient takes it (not in this case)\n\n15. Resume ACE inhibitor:\n    - Can restart lisinopril once creatinine back to baseline\n    - ACE-i important for long-term BP and kidney protection\n    - Just not safe during acute hypovolemia\n\nPain Management:\n\n16. For headache (patient's original complaint):\n    - Acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours PRN (safe in AKI)\n    - Avoid NSAIDs\n\nDisposition:\n\n17. Consider admission if:\n    - Severe AKI (Cr >3x baseline)\n    - Oliguria or anuria\n    - Hyperkalemia >5.5 or symptomatic\n    - Acidosis\n    - Volume overload\n    - Unable to tolerate oral fluids\n    - Needs IV fluids and close monitoring\n\n18. This patient: Borderline - can trial outpatient management with:\n    - IV fluid bolus in ED/office\n    - Aggressive oral hydration at home\n    - Close follow-up in 24-48 hours\n    - Low threshold to return\n\nIf Managing Outpatient:\n\n19. Oral hydration: 2-3 liters fluids over next 24 hours\n20. Stop ibuprofen, hold lisinopril\n21. Acetaminophen for pain\n22. Return precautions:\n    - Decreased urine output\n    - Worsening nausea/vomiting (can't drink)\n    - Confusion\n    - Swelling, shortness of breath\n    - Muscle weakness (hyperkalemia)\n\n23. Labs repeat in 24-48 hours (outpatient or return visit)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n24. Repeat BMP in 48 hours\n25. If creatinine improving: Continue supportive care, restart lisinopril once baseline\n26. If creatinine worsening: Renal ultrasound, nephrology consult, consider admission\n\nPatient Education:\n\n27. Kidneys temporarily injured from dehydration and ibuprofen\n28. Should recover with fluids and stopping ibuprofen\n29. Avoid all NSAIDs in future (ibuprofen, naproxen, meloxicam)\n30. If dehydrated in future: Hold blood pressure meds, drink fluids\n31. Follow up to ensure recovery"

Proteinuria >3.5 g/day \u2713 (14 g/day)\n2. Hypoalbuminemia \u2713 (albumin 1.8)\n3. Edema \u2713 (anasarca)\n4. Hyperlipidemia \u2713 (cholesterol 380, LDL 250)\n\nLikely Etiology:\n- Primary: FSGS, membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease\n- Secondary to diabetes (diabetic nephropathy) - very likely given 10-year DM history and poor control\n- Need kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis\n\n### Plan\nImmediate Management:\n\n1. Diuretics for edema (first priority for symptom relief):\n   - Furosemide 40-80 mg IV BID (loop diuretic)\n   - Add metolazone 5 mg daily if refractory (synergistic)\n   - Goal: Negative fluid balance, reduce edema\n   - Monitor: Weight daily, I/Os, creatinine, potassium\n\n2. Salt and fluid restriction:\n   - Sodium <2 g/day\n   - Fluid restriction 1.5-2 L/day\n\n3. Protein intake:\n   - Moderate protein diet (0.8-1 g/kg/day)\n   - Avoid excessive protein (worsens proteinuria)\n   - Avoid severe restriction (malnourishment)\n\n4. Albumin infusion:\n   - Consider if severe hypoalbuminemia with refractory edema\n   - 25% albumin IV followed by diuretics\n   - Temporary effect (albumin will be lost in urine)\n\nKidney Biopsy:\n\n5. Nephrology consult for kidney biopsy:\n   - Essential for diagnosis (determine specific glomerulopathy)\n   - Light microscopy, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy\n   - Will guide treatment (steroids, immunosuppression)\n\n6. Pre-biopsy checklist:\n   - Check coagulation (PT/INR, PTT)\n   - Hold anticoagulants\n   - Blood pressure controlled\n   - Platelets adequate\n\nDifferential Diagnosis (To Be Determined by Biopsy):\n\n7. Likely causes in this patient:\n   - Diabetic nephropathy (most likely given history)\n   - FSGS (common in adults)\n   - Membranous nephropathy (common adult primary cause)\n   - Minimal change disease (less common in adults)\n\n8. If diabetic nephropathy:\n   - Usually does NOT require biopsy if classic presentation\n   - Presence of diabetic retinopathy supports diagnosis\n   - Biopsy if atypical features (rapid onset, no retinopathy, hematuria)\n\n9. Order ophthalmology exam: Check for diabetic retinopathy (supports diabetic nephropathy)\n\nACE Inhibitor (Reduce Proteinuria):\n\n10. Continue lisinopril (already on):\n    - Reduces proteinuria independent of BP\n    - Renoprotective\n    - May increase to max dose if tolerated and BP allows\n    - Monitor potassium and creatinine (may worsen slightly initially)\n\n11. Can add ARB (dual blockade) for additional proteinuria reduction - but monitor closely\n\n12. Target: Reduce proteinuria as much as possible\n\nHyperlipidemia:\n\n13. Hyperlipidemia in nephrotic syndrome:\n    - Liver increases lipoprotein synthesis due to low albumin\n    - Increases cardiovascular risk\n\n14. Continue statin (atorvastatin)\n    - May increase to high-intensity dose (40-80 mg)\n    - Helps with lipids and may have renal benefit\n\n15. Lipids may improve as nephrotic syndrome treated\n\nAnticoagulation Consideration:\n\n16. Nephrotic syndrome = hypercoagulable state:\n    - Loss of antithrombin III in urine\n    - Increased risk of DVT, PE, renal vein thrombosis\n\n17. Prophylactic anticoagulation:\n    - Consider if: Albumin <2.0-2.5 g/dL, bedridden, prior VTE\n    - Risk vs benefit discussion\n    - If very low albumin (<2.0): Strong consideration for anticoagulation\n\n18. Patient albumin 1.8 - high risk:\n    - Consider low-dose anticoagulation\n    - Enoxaparin prophylactic dose or therapeutic\n    - Or warfarin/DOAC if ongoing risk\n\nInfection Risk:\n\n19. Nephrotic syndrome increases infection risk:\n    - Loss of immunoglobulins in urine\n    - Particularly susceptible to encapsulated organisms (S. pneumoniae)\n\n20. Vaccinations:\n    - Pneumococcal vaccine (PCV15/20 + PPSV23)\n    - Influenza annually\n\n21. Low threshold for evaluation if febrile\n\nDiabetes Management:\n\n22. HbA1c 8.5% - suboptimal\n23. Optimize glycemic control to slow diabetic nephropathy\n24. Metformin: May need to hold if creatinine worsening\n25. Consider insulin for tighter control\n26. SGLT2 inhibitors: May help with proteinuria and renal protection once stable\n    - Caution in nephrotic syndrome (volume depletion)\n    - Discuss with nephrology\n\nMonitoring:\n\n27. Daily weights (hospitalized)\n28. Strict I/Os\n29. BMP daily (creatinine, potassium)\n30. Albumin, urine protein periodically\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n31. Nephrology managing biopsy and treatment\n32. Based on biopsy results:\n    - Diabetic nephropathy: Optimize BP, glucose, ACE-i\n    - FSGS: Steroids, immunosuppression\n    - Membranous: May observe or immunosuppress depending on severity\n    - Minimal change: Prednisone very effective\n\n33. Repeat 24-hour urine protein in 4-6 weeks to assess response\n\nPatient Education:\n\n34. Nephrotic syndrome is kidney leaking protein into urine\n35. Causes swelling, low protein in blood\n36. Need biopsy to determine exact cause\n37. Treatment depends on cause\n38. Limit salt and fluid to help with swelling\n39. Take diuretics as prescribed\n40. At risk for blood clots - report any leg pain, swelling, shortness of breath"

Low urine volume (1.2 L) - major risk\n2. Hypercalciuria (elevated urine calcium)\n3. Hyperoxaluria (elevated urine oxalate)\n4. Hypocitraturia (low urine citrate)\n5. High sodium intake (increases urine calcium)\n6. High animal protein intake (increases uric acid, decreases citrate)\n7. Family history\n\n### Plan\nDietary Modifications (First-Line Prevention):\n\n1. INCREASE FLUID INTAKE (Most Important):\n   - Goal: Urine output >2.5 L/day\n   - Drink: 3+ liters of fluid daily (10+ glasses)\n   - Water is best; can include lemonade (citrate source)\n   - Spread intake throughout day and before bed\n   - Urine should be pale yellow/clear\n\n2. Reduce sodium intake:\n   - Goal: <2300 mg/day (ideally <1500 mg)\n   - High sodium increases urinary calcium excretion\n   - Avoid: Processed foods, fast food, canned soups, salty snacks\n   - Read labels\n\n3. Moderate animal protein:\n   - Limit to 1 serving (6 oz) per day\n   - High protein increases uric acid, decreases citrate\n   - Can substitute with plant proteins\n\n4. Reduce high-oxalate foods:\n   - Patient eating spinach salads daily - HIGH oxalate\n   - Limit or avoid: Spinach, rhubarb, beets, nuts, chocolate, tea\n   - Moderate oxalate foods in moderation: Berries, beans, potatoes\n\n5. Maintain adequate calcium intake (DO NOT restrict):\n   - Dietary calcium binds oxalate in gut, reducing absorption\n   - Goal: 1000-1200 mg/day from food (not supplements)\n   - Dairy products with meals\n   - Calcium supplements can increase stone risk (avoid if possible)\n\n6. Increase citrate intake:\n   - Citrate inhibits stone formation\n   - Lemonade (real lemon juice), oranges, citrus fruits\n   - Or supplement with potassium citrate (see below)\n\nMedical Therapy:\n\n7. Potassium citrate (for hypocitraturia):\n   - Citrate inhibits calcium stone formation\n   - Increases urine citrate and pH\n   - Prescribe: Potassium citrate 10-20 mEq BID-TID\n   - Start: Potassium citrate 10 mEq BID\n   - Take with meals\n   - Monitor: Potassium level, urine citrate\n\n8. If hypercalciuria persists despite diet:\n   - Thiazide diuretic: Reduces urinary calcium\n   - Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily or chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg daily\n   - Also helpful for blood pressure\n   - Side effects: Hypokalemia (monitor and supplement)\n\n9. Prescriptions:\n   - Potassium citrate 10 mEq, take 1 tablet BID with meals\n   - Consider thiazide in future if calcium remains high\n\nMonitoring:\n\n10. Repeat 24-hour urine collection in 3 months:\n    - Assess response to interventions\n    - Goal: Volume >2.5 L, calcium <200, oxalate <40, citrate >550\n    - Adjust treatment based on results\n\n11. Labs:\n    - BMP (potassium) in 4-6 weeks (on potassium citrate)\n    - Annual metabolic panel\n\n12. Imaging:\n    - Not needed routinely if asymptomatic\n    - Low-dose CT or ultrasound if new symptoms\n\nGeneral Prevention Measures:\n\n13. Weight management: Maintain healthy weight (BMI 24, good)\n14. Exercise regularly\n15. Limit vitamin C supplements (metabolizes to oxalate)\n16. Avoid high-dose calcium supplements (take with food if needed)\n\nIf Symptoms Recur:\n\n17. Signs of stone passage:\n    - Sudden severe flank pain radiating to groin\n    - Nausea/vomiting\n    - Blood in urine\n\n18. Management if symptomatic stone:\n    - Hydration, pain control (NSAIDs, opioids)\n    - CT to confirm stone size and location\n    - Small stones (<5-6 mm): May pass with medical expulsive therapy (tamsulosin)\n    - Large stones: Urology referral (lithotripsy, ureteroscopy)\n\n19. Always strain urine during stone episodes to collect stones for analysis\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n20. Return in 3 months:\n    - Review diet diary\n    - Repeat 24-hour urine\n    - Assess medication tolerance\n    - Adjust treatment plan\n\n21. Consider urology referral if:\n    - Continued stone formation despite prevention\n    - Anatomic abnormalities\n    - Need for surgical intervention\n\nPatient Education:\n\n22. Recurrent stones are preventable with diet and medication\n23. Hydration is the single most important factor\n24. Dietary changes take time but are effective\n25. Medication helps if diet alone isn't enough\n26. Must follow up with urine testing to guide treatment\n27. Report any symptoms of new stone immediately"

Causes of ATN:\n   a) Contrast-Induced AKI (CI-AKI):\n      - Contrast 48-72 hours ago\n      - Risk factors: Diabetes, CKD, volume depletion\n      - Timing consistent (24-72h after contrast)\n   \n   b) Ischemic ATN:\n      - Hypotensive episode during cath\n      - Reduced cardiac output from NSTEMI\n   \n   c) Nephrotoxic ATN:\n      - NSAID use (ibuprofen pre-admission)\n      - Contrast\n\n3. Contributing Factors:\n   - ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) - reduces GFR\n   - Diuretics - volume depletion, tubular stress\n   - Metformin - should be held (contrast + AKI = lactic acidosis risk)\n\n### Plan\nACUTE KIDNEY INJURY - ATN MANAGEMENT:\n\n1. STOP Nephrotoxins:\n   - STOP Lisinopril (ACE inhibitor - reduces GFR, hyperkalemia)\n   - STOP Metformin (lactic acidosis risk with AKI)\n   - STOP NSAIDs (avoid)\n   - STOP Furosemide (reassess volume status first)\n   - Avoid contrast (no repeat imaging with contrast)\n   - Avoid aminoglycosides, amphotericin if needed\n\n2. Volume Status Assessment:\n   - Currently: 2 kg up from admission, crackles (mild volume overload)\n   - However, may have been intravascularly depleted leading to ATN\n   - Careful assessment:\n     - If truly volume overloaded (CHF): May need diuretics\n     - If intravascularly dry: IV fluids\n   - Given ATN already established: Focus on maintaining euvolemia\n\n3. Fluid Management:\n   - Hold diuretics temporarily (assess response)\n   - Isotonic fluids cautiously if hypovolemic (NS or LR)\n   - Strict I/O monitoring\n   - Daily weights\n   - If volume overloaded and oliguric: May need dialysis\n\n4. Hyperkalemia Management (K 5.8):\n   - ECG: Check for peaked T waves, widened QRS\n   - If ECG changes: Calcium gluconate 1g IV for cardiac membrane stabilization\n   - Insulin 10 units IV + D50 50 mL IV (shift K intracellularly)\n   - Sodium bicarbonate if acidotic (HCO3 18 - yes, acidosis)\n   - Kayexalate 30g PO or PR (remove K from body)\n   - If refractory or severe: Dialysis\n\n5. Metabolic Acidosis (HCO3 18):\n   - ATN with uremic acidosis\n   - Sodium bicarbonate supplementation if HCO3 <18 or symptomatic\n   - Target HCO3 >22\n   - If refractory: Dialysis indication\n\n6. Monitor for Uremic Symptoms:\n   - Encephalopathy, pericarditis, bleeding\n   - If present: Urgent dialysis\n\n7. Renal Replacement Therapy (Dialysis) Indications:\n   Assess for AEIOU:\n   - Acidosis (refractory, pH <7.1)\n   - Electrolytes (refractory hyperkalemia K >6.5 despite treatment)\n   - Intoxication (not applicable)\n   - Overload (volume overload refractory to diuretics)\n   - Uremia (encephalopathy, pericarditis, bleeding)\n\n   Current status: May need dialysis if K or acidosis refractory\n   Nephrology consultation for dialysis planning\n\n8. Nephrology Consultation:\n   - Urgent nephrology consult\n   - Assess need for dialysis\n   - Dialysis catheter placement if needed (temporary vascular access)\n\n9. Medication Dose Adjustments:\n   - Review all medications for renal dosing\n   - Reduce/hold renally cleared medications\n   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications\n\n10. Urine Output Monitoring:\n    - Hourly urine output via Foley\n    - Goal: >0.5 mL/kg/hr (>40 mL/hr for this patient)\n    - Document I/O precisely\n\n11. Daily Labs:\n    - BMP daily (Cr, K, HCO3)\n    - CBC (anemia of CKD/AKI)\n    - Phosphorus, calcium, magnesium\n\n12. Avoid Further Insults:\n    - No contrast imaging\n    - Renally dose all medications\n    - Maintain euvolemia\n    - Avoid hypotension\n\n13. Prognosis:\n    - ATN typically recovers in 1-3 weeks\n    - May have prolonged oliguria then polyuric recovery phase\n    - Some patients don't fully recover (CKD progression)\n    - Contrast-induced AKI usually reversible\n\nCARDIAC CONSIDERATIONS:\n\n14. NSTEMI Management with AKI:\n    - Continue aspirin, clopidogrel (stent in place)\n    - Hold ACE inhibitor (restart when Cr stabilizes)\n    - Beta-blocker can continue\n    - Statin can continue\n\n15. Volume Management Balance:\n    - Heart needs euvolemia (pulmonary edema if overloaded)\n    - Kidneys need adequate perfusion (don't over-diurese)\n    - Balance is challenging - may need cardiology-nephrology coordination\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n16. Serial creatinine (expect plateau then gradual decline if recovering)\n17. Urine output trends\n18. Nephrology follow-up post-discharge\n19. Repeat renal function in 1 week after discharge\n20. May have residual CKD - long-term monitoring needed"

Cardiac Membrane Stabilization:\n   - Calcium gluconate 10% 1g (10 mL) IV over 2-3 minutes\n   - Does NOT lower K, but stabilizes cardiac membrane\n   - Prevents arrhythmias\n   - Repeat ECG after administration\n   - Can repeat in 5-10 minutes if ECG still abnormal\n\n2. Shift Potassium Intracellularly:\n   \n   a) Insulin + Glucose:\n      - Regular insulin 10 units IV\n      - PLUS Dextrose 50% (D50) 50 mL IV (25g glucose)\n      - Shifts K into cells within 15-30 minutes\n      - Lasts 4-6 hours\n      - Monitor glucose (already diabetic)\n\n   b) Albuterol Nebulizer:\n      - Albuterol 10-20 mg nebulized\n      - Shifts K into cells\n      - Additive effect with insulin\n      - May cause tachycardia\n\n   c) Sodium Bicarbonate:\n      - Less effective alone, but patient is acidotic (HCO3 15)\n      - NaHCO3 50-100 mEq IV\n      - Helps shift K if acidotic\n      - Use cautiously (sodium load in volume-overloaded patient)\n\n3. Remove Potassium from Body:\n   \n   a) URGENT HEMODIALYSIS (Definitive Treatment):\n      - Removes K, fluid, and uremic toxins\n      - Arrange EMERGENTLY\n      - Call dialysis unit or interventional nephrology\n      - Use patient's AV fistula (functional)\n      - If fistula not usable: Temporary dialysis catheter\n\n   b) GI Cation Exchangers (while awaiting dialysis):\n      - Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) 30g PO\n      - OR Patiromer or Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (faster acting)\n      - These take hours to work - NOT immediate\n\n   c) Loop Diuretic (Limited in ESRD):\n      - Furosemide 80-200 mg IV (may have minimal effect if anuric)\n      - Try if patient has residual urine output\n\n**CONTINUOUS MONITORING:**\n\n4. Cardiac Monitoring:\n   - Continuous telemetry\n   - Repeat ECG after each intervention\n   - Watch for VTach, VFib, asystole\n\n5. Repeat Labs:\n   - K+ every 2 hours until in dialysis\n   - ABG if needed for acidosis\n\n**VOLUME OVERLOAD MANAGEMENT:**\n\n6. Oxygen:\n   - Nasal cannula or face mask for O2 sat >92%\n   - If worsening: BiPAP or intubation\n   - Sitting upright (decreases preload)\n\n7. Nitroglycerin (if hypertensive and pulmonary edema):\n   - NTG 0.4 mg SL or IV drip\n   - Reduces preload, improves pulmonary edema\n   - Monitor BP\n\n8. Morphine (with caution):\n   - 2-4 mg IV for dyspnea and anxiety\n   - Reduces preload\n   - Use carefully in renal failure (accumulates)\n\n9. Dialysis Ultrafiltration:\n   - Remove 3-4 liters during dialysis session\n   - Goal: Return to dry weight (65 kg)\n   - May need extended or additional sessions\n\n**HEMODIALYSIS SPECIFICS:**\n\n10. Urgent Hemodialysis Order:\n    - Access: Left AV fistula\n    - Duration: 3-4 hours\n    - Ultrafiltration goal: 3-4 L (based on fluid excess)\n    - Dialysate K: 2 mEq/L (standard for hyperkalemia)\n    - Dialysate Ca: 2.5 mEq/L\n    - Heparin: Standard dosing\n\n11. Post-Dialysis Goals:\n    - K <5.5 mEq/L\n    - Weight at dry weight (65 kg)\n    - Improved respiratory status\n    - Resolution of ECG changes\n\n**PREVENT RECURRENCE:**\n\n12. Dietary Counseling:\n    - Low potassium diet education\n    - Avoid: Bananas, oranges, tomatoes, potatoes, salt substitutes\n    - Low sodium diet (fluid retention)\n    - Renal dietitian consult\n\n13. Address Barriers to Dialysis Adherence:\n    - Transportation: Arrange reliable transport (medical transportation services)\n    - Social work consult for resources\n    - Discuss consequences of missed dialysis (life-threatening)\n\n14. Dialysis Schedule:\n    - Resume MWF schedule\n    - May need extra session this week to catch up\n    - Consider increasing dialysis time if frequently overloaded\n\n15. Medication Review:\n    - Ensure taking phosphate binders (sevelamer)\n    - Potassium binders at home if recurrent hyperkalemia (Lokelma, Veltassa)\n    - Fluid restriction education\n\n**MONITORING:**\n\n16. Labs Post-Dialysis:\n    - BMP, CBC\n    - Confirm K normalized\n    - Assess adequacy (URR, Kt/V)\n\n17.

High-dose IV corticosteroids:\n   - Methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV daily x 3-5 days\n   - Speeds recovery from acute relapse\n   - Does not affect long-term disability\n\n2. Alternative: High-dose oral prednisone (1250 mg) may be equivalent (if IV not feasible)\n\n3. After IV steroids: Optional oral prednisone taper\n\n4. Monitor blood glucose (steroids cause hyperglycemia)\n5. PPI for GI protection during steroids\n6. Monitor for steroid side effects (insomnia, mood changes)\n\nDisease-Modifying Therapy (DMT) - ESSENTIAL:\n\n7. Start DMT promptly - reduces relapses, slows disability\n\n8. DMT Options by Efficacy:\n\n   Platform/Moderate Efficacy:\n   - Interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif)\n   - Interferon beta-1b (Betaseron)\n   - Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone)\n   - Teriflunomide (Aubagio) - oral\n   - Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) - oral\n\n   High Efficacy:\n   - Natalizumab (Tysabri) - IV monthly, risk of PML\n   - Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) - IV q6 months, anti-CD20\n   - Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) - high efficacy, significant risks\n   - Cladribine (Mavenclad) - oral, immunomodulator\n   - Ofatumumab (Kesimpta) - SQ monthly, anti-CD20\n\n9. Current Trend: Early high-efficacy therapy for active disease\n\n10. Recommended for this patient:\n    - Consider high-efficacy DMT given active disease (enhancing lesion)\n    - Options: Ocrelizumab, Ofatumumab, or Natalizumab\n    - Discuss with patient, shared decision-making\n\n11. If starting Natalizumab:\n    - JC virus antibody testing required\n    - If JCV+, higher risk of PML, consider alternative\n\n12. If starting Ocrelizumab:\n    - Screen for Hepatitis B (reactivation risk)\n    - Pre-medicate for infusion reactions\n    - Complete vaccinations before starting\n\nPre-DMT Workup:\n\n13. CBC, CMP, LFTs\n14. Hepatitis B and C screening\n15. JC virus antibody (if Natalizumab considered)\n16. Varicella titer (if no history)\n17. TB screening\n18. Complete vaccinations before immunosuppression:\n    - Influenza, Pneumococcal, Hepatitis B, COVID-19\n    - Live vaccines (Shingrix preferred over live zoster, MMR, Varicella) should be given BEFORE DMT if needed\n\nSymptom Management:\n\n19. Spasticity:\n    - Baclofen 5 mg TID, titrate up\n    - Alternative: Tizanidine\n    - Physical therapy, stretching\n\n20. Bladder urgency:\n    - Oxybutynin 5 mg BID or tolterodine\n    - Urology referral if persistent\n    - Post-void residual check\n\n21. Fatigue:\n    - Sleep hygiene, exercise\n    - Amantadine 100 mg BID or modafinil if severe\n\n22. Neuropathic symptoms:\n    - Gabapentin or pregabalin if painful paresthesias\n\nRehabilitation:\n\n23. Physical therapy: Gait training, balance, strengthening\n24. Occupational therapy if upper extremity affected\n25. Regular exercise (improves fatigue, function)\n\nLifestyle:\n\n26. Vitamin D supplementation:\n    - Check 25-OH Vitamin D level\n    - Supplement to goal >40 ng/mL\n    - Most MS patients are deficient\n\n27. Smoking cessation (if applicable) - worsens MS\n28. Healthy diet, weight management\n29. Avoid heat (can worsen symptoms - Uhthoff phenomenon)\n\nMonitoring on DMT:\n\n30. MRI brain annually (or per DMT protocol)\n31. Clinical assessment every 3-6 months\n32. Labs per specific DMT monitoring schedule\n33. Watch for new relapses\n\nPregnancy Considerations:\n\n34. Discuss family planning\n35. Many DMTs contraindicated in pregnancy\n36. Some DMTs require washout before conception\n37. MS itself often improves during pregnancy\n\nPrognosis:\n\n38. RRMS has better prognosis than progressive forms\n39. Early DMT initiation improves long-term outcomes\n40. Some patients transition to secondary progressive MS over decades\n41. Good prognostic factors: Female, younger, sensory symptoms, full recovery from attacks\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n42. Neurology in 1-2 weeks after steroids\n43. Initiate DMT as soon as workup complete\n44. Regular MS clinic follow-up\n45. MRI surveillance per protocol"

Motor fluctuations (wearing-off phenomenon)\n2. Gait freezing with falls\n3. Orthostatic hypotension\n4. Mild cognitive impairment\n5. REM sleep behavior disorder\n6. Depression/anxiety\n\nPathophysiology of Wearing-Off:\n- Progressive dopamine neuron loss\n- Narrowing therapeutic window of levodopa\n- Levodopa half-life only ~90 minutes\n- Need more frequent dosing or adjunctive therapy\n\n### Plan\nOptimizing Levodopa:\n\n1. Increase dosing frequency:\n   - Change to Carbidopa/Levodopa 25/100 mg QID or 5x/day\n   - Smaller, more frequent doses extend \"on\" time\n   - Example: 8 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM, 8 PM\n\n2. May increase individual doses if tolerated:\n   - 25/100 to 25/250 per dose if needed\n   - Watch for dyskinesias with higher doses\n\n3. Take levodopa on empty stomach (30-60 min before meals):\n   - Protein competes for absorption\n   - Avoid high-protein meals around dosing\n\nAdd Adjunctive Therapy:\n\n4. COMT Inhibitor (Extends Levodopa Duration):\n   - Entacapone 200 mg with each levodopa dose\n   - Or combination pill: Stalevo (carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone)\n   - Extends \"on\" time, reduces \"off\" periods\n   - Side effects: Diarrhea, urine discoloration (orange)\n\n5.

Dopamine Agonist (Consider with Caution in Elderly):\n   - Pramipexole, Ropinirole, Rotigotine patch\n   - Effective for motor fluctuations\n   - CAUTION in elderly: Hallucinations, confusion, impulse control disorders\n   - If used, start very low dose\n\n8. Recommended additions for this patient:\n   - ADD Entacapone 200 mg with each levodopa dose (or switch to Stalevo)\n   - ADD Rasagiline 1 mg daily\n\nGait Freezing and Falls:\n\n9. Physical therapy ESSENTIAL:\n   - Gait training, cueing strategies\n   - Visual cues (laser pointer on cane, tape lines on floor)\n   - Auditory cues (metronome)\n   - Strengthening, balance exercises\n\n10. Assistive device: Rolling walker with hand brakes\n\n11. Home safety evaluation:\n    - Remove throw rugs, clutter\n    - Adequate lighting\n    - Grab bars in bathroom\n\n12. Treat orthostatic hypotension (contributes to falls):\n    - Hydration, salt intake (if no CHF/HTN contraindication)\n    - Compression stockings\n    - Rise slowly from sitting/lying\n    - Midodrine 5-10 mg TID if severe\n    - Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily alternative\n\nOrthostatic Hypotension:\n\n13. Likely multifactorial: PD autonomic dysfunction + medications\n14. Review and reduce antihypertensives if possible\n15. Conservative measures as above\n16. Droxidopa (Northera) if refractory\n\nCognitive Impairment:\n\n17. MMSE 26/30 - mild impairment (PD-MCI)\n18. Screen for PD dementia progression\n19. If dementia develops: Rivastigmine (Exelon) is approved for PD dementia\n20. Avoid anticholinergic medications (worsen cognition)\n\nREM Sleep Behavior Disorder:\n\n21. RBD common prodrome and accompaniment of PD\n22. Melatonin 3-12 mg at bedtime (first-line, safe)\n23. If melatonin insufficient: Clonazepam 0.25-0.5 mg at bedtime (caution in elderly)\n24. Bed safety: Lower bed, remove sharp objects\n\nDepression/Anxiety:\n\n25. Common in PD (up to 50%)\n26. Options:\n    - SSRI: Sertraline, citalopram (no significant interaction with MAO-B inhibitors at low doses)\n    - SNRI: Venlafaxine, duloxetine\n    - Pramipexole has antidepressant effects (if tolerated)\n\n27. Counseling, support groups\n\nAvoid:\n\n28. Anticholinergics (confusion, worsen cognition)\n29. Antipsychotics (most block dopamine and worsen PD)\n    - If psychosis develops: Pimavanserin (Nuplazid) or Clozapine\n30. Metoclopramide (blocks dopamine)\n\nAdvanced Therapies (If Motor Fluctuations Refractory):\n\n31. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):\n    - For medically refractory motor fluctuations/dyskinesias\n    - Best candidates: Good levodopa response, no dementia, <75 years ideal\n    - Subthalamic nucleus or Globus pallidus interna targets\n\n32. Duopa (Carbidopa-Levodopa Enteral Suspension):\n    - Continuous intestinal infusion via PEG-J tube\n    - Reduces fluctuations significantly\n\n33. Apomorphine:\n    - Subcutaneous injection for \"rescue\" of off episodes\n    - Or continuous subcutaneous infusion\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n34. Neurology/Movement Disorders in 4-6 weeks\n35. Reassess motor fluctuations\n36. Adjust medications as needed\n37. Physical therapy ongoing\n38. Annual reassessment of cognition, mood"

Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound \u2713\n\nAll three criteria met.\n\nMetabolic Syndrome Components:\n- Central obesity (waist >35 inches) \u2713\n- Prediabetes (HbA1c 5.9%, fasting glucose 108) \u2713\n- Dyslipidemia (low HDL, high TG) \u2713\n- Hypertension: Borderline (128/82)\n- Insulin resistance \u2713\n\nInfertility: Anovulatory (no ovulation = no pregnancy)\n\nEndometrial Considerations:\n- Thickened endometrium (12mm) + chronic anovulation \u2192 Risk of endometrial hyperplasia\n- May need endometrial biopsy if prolonged anovulation\n\n### Plan\nPatient Goals: Pregnancy\n\nWeight Loss (First-Line for PCOS with Obesity):\n1. Weight loss counseling: Even 5-10% weight loss can restore ovulation\n2. Caloric restriction: 500-750 kcal/day deficit\n3. Low glycemic index diet (reduces insulin resistance)\n4. Regular exercise: 150 min/week moderate intensity\n5. Consider structured weight loss program\n6. Referral to nutritionist/dietitian\n7. Weight loss may restore spontaneous ovulation\n\nMetformin (Insulin Sensitizer):\n8. Metformin 500mg daily with dinner, increase to 500mg BID after 1-2 weeks\n9. Target: 1500-2000 mg daily as tolerated\n10. Benefits: Improves insulin sensitivity, may restore ovulation, reduces miscarriage risk\n11. GI side effects: Start low, take with food, extended-release better tolerated\n12. Safe in pregnancy, some continue through first trimester\n\nOvulation Induction (Infertility Treatment):\n13. First-line: Letrozole (aromatase inhibitor)\n    - More effective than clomiphene for PCOS\n    - Start 2.5 mg days 3-7 of cycle\n    - Increase to 5 mg, then 7.5 mg if no ovulation\n14. Alternative: Clomiphene citrate 50 mg days 5-9\n    - Increase to 100 mg, then 150 mg if needed\n15. Monitoring:\n    - Transvaginal ultrasound on cycle day 12-14 for follicle development\n    - If dominant follicle \u226518-20 mm: Trigger with hCG (Ovidrel) or monitor for LH surge\n16. Timed intercourse around ovulation\n17. If ovulation confirmed: Wait for pregnancy test\n18. If no pregnancy after 3-6 ovulatory cycles: Consider next steps\n\nSecond-Line (If Letrozole/Clomiphene Fail):\n19. Gonadotropins (FSH injections): Gonal-F, Follistim\n    - Higher success but higher risk of multiples, OHSS\n    - Requires close monitoring\n20. Ovarian drilling (laparoscopic) - less common now\n21. IVF if other methods fail\n\nRefer to Reproductive Endocrinology/Infertility if:\n22. No ovulation with letrozole up to 7.5 mg\n23. No pregnancy after 3-6 ovulatory cycles\n24. Age >35 or other factors\n25. Desire for IVF\n\nEndometrial Protection:\n26. With anovulation, unopposed estrogen \u2192 endometrial hyperplasia risk\n27. While trying to conceive: Provera 10 mg x 10 days to induce withdrawal bleed if no period >60 days\n28. If not trying to conceive: Would recommend OCPs (but patient wants pregnancy)\n29. Endometrial biopsy if prolonged anovulation or abnormal bleeding\n30. Ultrasound shows 12mm endometrium - will shed with ovulation or progestin withdrawal\n\nManage Hyperandrogenic Symptoms:\n31. While trying to conceive: Limited options (many treatments contraindicated)\n32. For hirsutism:\n    - Mechanical: Shaving, waxing, laser hair removal, electrolysis\n    - Spironolactone and OCPs would help but contraindicated in pregnancy attempt\n33. For acne:\n    - Topical retinoids (discontinue if pregnant - teratogenic)\n    - Topical benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics\n34. Will address after pregnancy achieved\n\nMetabolic Management:\n35. Prediabetes: Metformin + lifestyle modification\n36. Recheck HbA1c in 3 months\n37. Dyslipidemia: Lifestyle modification first\n    - Statins contraindicated in pregnancy\n38. Blood pressure: Monitor, lifestyle modification\n39. Screen for obstructive sleep apnea (common in PCOS with obesity)\n\nLong-Term Risks (Counsel):\n40. Type 2 diabetes: High risk (annual screening)\n41. Cardiovascular disease: Elevated risk\n42. Endometrial cancer: Due to unopposed estrogen\n43. NASH/fatty liver\n44. Pregnancy complications: GDM, preeclampsia, miscarriage\n\nPrenatal Optimization:\n45. Continue prenatal vitamin with folate\n46. Optimize weight before pregnancy if possible\n47. Control prediabetes (reduces GDM risk)\n48. Early glucose testing in pregnancy (GDM risk higher with PCOS)\n\nFollow-up:\n49. OB/GYN in 1 month to start ovulation induction\n50. Cycle day 3 labs (if cycle induced)\n51. Ultrasound monitoring during ovulation induction\n52. Nutritionist appointment for weight loss program\n53. Recheck metabolic labs in 3 months\n54.

Iron supplementation: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg elemental iron) BID-TID\n2. Take with vitamin C to enhance absorption\n3. Consider IV iron infusion for faster repletion:\n   - Iron sucrose or Ferric carboxymaltose\n   - Especially if oral iron not tolerated or urgent surgery planned\n4. Recheck CBC and ferritin in 4-6 weeks\n5. Goal Hgb >12 g/dL before elective surgery\n\nMedical Management Options (Can Try First):\n6. Hormonal therapy:\n   - Levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena): Reduces bleeding 90%, can shrink submucosal fibroids slightly\n     - Less effective with large cavity distortion\n   - Oral progestins: Norethindrone acetate 5-10 mg daily (cycle or continuous)\n   - Combined oral contraceptives: Regulate cycles, reduce bleeding\n7. Tranexamic acid (Lysteda) 1300 mg TID during heavy days (antifibrinolytic)\n8. NSAIDs during menses (reduce bleeding 20-40%)\n9. GnRH agonists (Lupron): Shrink fibroids preoperatively, induce amenorrhea\n   - Max 6 months (bone loss)\n   - Often used as bridge to surgery\n\nLimitations of Medical Management:\n10. Large submucosal fibroid likely to limit Mirena efficacy/placement\n11. Medical management controls symptoms but does not treat fibroids\n12. Fibroids may continue to grow until menopause\n\nSurgical Options (Definitive for Symptomatic Fibroids, No Future Fertility):\n\n13. Hysterectomy (Definitive Treatment):\n    - Recommended given: Completed childbearing, multiple fibroids, failed medical management option, anemia\n    - Approach options:\n      a. Laparoscopic/robotic hysterectomy (preferred if feasible)\n      b. Vaginal hysterectomy (if uterus small enough)\n      c. Abdominal hysterectomy (if very large uterus)\n    - Total vs supracervical: Patient preference, discuss\n    - Ovarian conservation: Keep ovaries (age 45, not near menopause)\n    - Cure rate: 100% (removes uterus = no fibroids, no bleeding)\n\n14. Uterine Fibroid Embolization (UFE):\n    - Interventional radiology procedure\n    - Blocks blood supply to fibroids \u2192 shrinkage\n    - Uterus-sparing (though fertility not a concern here)\n    - 85-90% improvement in bleeding\n    - Risk: Post-embolization syndrome, rare uterine infection\n    - Consider if patient prefers to avoid surgery\n\n15. Hysteroscopic Myomectomy:\n    - For submucosal fibroid (2.5 cm Type 1)\n    - Resects fibroid from inside uterus\n    - Addresses cavity-distorting fibroid\n    - Does not address intramural/subserosal fibroids\n    - May be incomplete solution for this patient\n\n16. Laparoscopic/Abdominal Myomectomy:\n    - Uterus-sparing removal of fibroids\n    - Usually for patients desiring fertility\n    - Fibroids can recur\n    - Less appropriate for patient not desiring fertility\n\n17. Endometrial Ablation:\n    - Destroys endometrium to reduce bleeding\n    - Less effective with submucosal fibroids\n    - Not addressing bulk symptoms\n    - Contraindication: Submucosal fibroid may limit efficacy\n\nRecommendation for This Patient:\n18. Given: Age 45, completed fertility, multiple fibroids including submucosal, bulk symptoms, anemia\n19. Recommend: Hysterectomy (definitive, addresses all symptoms)\n20. Approach: Laparoscopic or robotic (minimally invasive preferred)\n21. Alternative: UFE if patient prefers non-surgical\n\nPreoperative:\n22. Correct anemia before elective surgery (goal Hgb >10 g/dL minimum)\n23. Options to bridge:\n    - GnRH agonist (Lupron) to induce amenorrhea and shrink fibroids\n    - Continuous OCPs or progestin to suppress bleeding\n    - IV iron infusion for rapid repletion\n24. Preoperative workup: CBC, CMP, type and screen, EKG (if indicated)\n25. Cervical cancer screening: Update Pap if due\n26. Endometrial biopsy: Done - benign\n\nCounseling:\n27. Discuss all options: Medical, UFE, hysterectomy, myomectomy\n28. Hysterectomy = permanent, no future pregnancy\n29. Risks of surgery: Bleeding, infection, injury to adjacent organs, anesthetic risks\n30. Benefits: Resolution of bleeding, bulk symptoms, anemia\n31. Menopause considerations: Ovaries conserved = natural menopause later, no HRT needed immediately\n\nFollow-up:\n33. GYN surgery scheduling within 2-4 weeks for pre-op counseling\n34. Recheck Hgb in 4-6 weeks after iron therapy\n35. If unable to optimize Hgb: Consider GnRH agonist bridge + IV iron\n36. Finalize surgical plan and consent"

(No - has 4 children, protective)\n- No exogenous hormone use\n- Hypertension \u2713\n\nConcern for Concurrent Cancer:\n- EMB can miss cancer (samples only 5-15% of cavity)\n- Need definitive surgical evaluation\n\n### Plan\nCounseling:\n1. Explain diagnosis: Precancerous change of uterine lining\n2. HIGH risk of concurrent cancer (25-40% on hysterectomy specimen)\n3. HIGH risk of progression to cancer if untreated\n4. Definitive treatment recommended: Hysterectomy\n\nDefinitive Treatment - Hysterectomy (Recommended):\n5. Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TH/BSO)\n   - Removes uterus, cervix, tubes, and ovaries\n   - Postmenopausal: No ovarian preservation needed\n   - Tubes removed (reduces ovarian cancer risk)\n6. Approach:\n   - Minimally invasive preferred (laparoscopic or robotic)\n   - Vaginal may be challenging with BMI 38\n   - Abdominal if MIS not feasible\n7. Surgical staging considerations:\n   - If final pathology shows cancer: May need staging (lymph nodes, washings)\n   - Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be performed at time of hysterectomy\n   - Gynecologic oncology involvement recommended\n\nReferral:\n8. Refer to Gynecologic Oncology\n   - Given high risk of concurrent malignancy\n   - Can perform appropriate staging if cancer found\n   - Experienced with complex patients (obesity, comorbidities)\n\nPreoperative Workup:\n9. CBC, CMP, coagulation studies\n10. Type and screen\n11. EKG (age, diabetes, hypertension)\n12. Chest X-ray (if indicated)\n13. Consider echocardiogram (cardiology clearance for obese diabetic patient)\n14. Anesthesia preoperative evaluation (high-risk patient)\n15. Optimize diabetes before surgery (target HbA1c <8%)\n16. Blood pressure control\n\nAdditional Imaging (If Desired/Indicated):\n17. Pelvic MRI: Can assess depth of myometrial invasion if cancer suspected\n18. Consider if suspicion for cancer is high\n19. Not mandatory before hysterectomy for atypical hyperplasia\n\nIf Patient Declines or Cannot Have Surgery:\n20. Alternative for patients who refuse/cannot have surgery:\n    - High-dose progestin therapy:\n      a. Mirena IUD (levonorgestrel 52 mg)\n      b. Megestrol acetate 160 mg daily\n      c. Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10-20 mg daily\n21. Must have close follow-up with repeat EMB every 3 months\n22. High failure rate with atypia - 50% or more may not respond\n23. Cancer risk persists\n24. Generally NOT recommended as first-line for atypical hyperplasia\n25. Only for patients who are poor surgical candidates or refuse surgery\n\nManage Ongoing Bleeding:\n26. If heavy bleeding while awaiting surgery:\n    - Provera 10-20 mg daily to control bleeding\n    - Or Mirena IUD placement (also therapeutic)\n27. Monitor hemoglobin\n28. Iron supplementation if anemic\n\nRisk Factor Modification:\n29. Weight loss counseling (reduces estrogen, improves surgical outcomes)\n30. Diabetes control (HbA1c 8.4% - improve to <7-8%)\n31. Blood pressure control\n32. These affect surgical risk and overall health\n\nFamily History Consideration:\n33. Sister with endometrial cancer at 60\n34. Consider Lynch syndrome (hereditary cancer syndrome):\n    - Endometrial, colon, ovarian cancer clustering\n    - If hysterectomy specimen shows cancer: Test tumor for MMR deficiency\n    - Consider genetic counseling and testing\n35. Colonoscopy if not up to date\n\nPatient Education:\n36. Atypical hyperplasia is a precursor to cancer\n37. Hysterectomy is curative if no cancer, and provides diagnosis if cancer present\n38. Delay increases cancer risk\n39. Surgery is safest approach despite comorbidities\n40. Ovary removal eliminates ovarian cancer risk and additional estrogen source\n\nFollow-up:\n41. Gynecologic Oncology appointment within 1-2 weeks\n42. Preoperative clearance appointments as needed\n43. Schedule surgery within 4-6 weeks ideally\n44. Support for perioperative optimization (diabetes, weight, BP)"

AVOID ALCOHOL during and 24 hours after metronidazole (48 hours for tinidazole) - disulfiram-like reaction\n5. Patient counseled on alcohol avoidance\n\nPartner Treatment (Essential):\n6. Partner MUST be treated (or will reinfect patient)\n7. Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT):\n   - Prescribe metronidazole 2g PO single dose for partner\n   - Provide to patient to give to partner\n   - Legal in most states - check local laws\n8. All partners in past 60 days should be treated\n9. No sex until patient AND partner(s) treated and symptoms resolved (at least 7 days)\n\nTest of Cure:\n10. Retest in 3 months (high reinfection rate)\n11. Rescreening recommended for all treated patients within 3 months\n12. Sooner if symptoms persist/recur\n\nScreen for Other STIs:\n13. GC/CT NAAT testing (coinfection common)\n14. HIV testing (trichomoniasis increases HIV risk/transmission)\n15. Syphilis serology (RPR)\n16. Hepatitis B (if not vaccinated)\n17. Consider Hepatitis C if risk factors\n18. Treat any coinfections identified\n\nIf GC/CT Positive:\n19. Treat per CDC guidelines:\n    - Chlamydia: Doxycycline 100mg BID x 7 days\n    - Gonorrhea: Ceftriaxone 500mg IM single dose\n20. Partner treatment for those as well\n\nCounseling:\n21. Trichomoniasis is sexually transmitted\n22. Partner must be treated or reinfection will occur\n23. Abstain from sex for 7 days after both partners treated\n24. Condom use reduces transmission (use consistently)\n25. Alcohol avoidance with metronidazole (nausea, vomiting, flushing)\n\nSafe Sex Practices:\n26. Consistent condom use with all partners\n27. Limit number of sexual partners\n28. Know partner's STI status\n29. Regular STI screening if multiple partners or new partners\n30. Consider PrEP discussion if high-risk for HIV\n\nVaccinations:\n31. Hepatitis B vaccine if not immunized\n32. HPV vaccine if not completed (<45 years old)\n33. Check immunization status\n\nFollow-up:\n34. Return if symptoms do not improve in 7 days\n35. Rescreening in 3 months\n36. Annual STI screening if sexually active with multiple partners\n37. Pap smear due (every 3 years if normal, age 21-29)\n38.

Reports severe dysmenorrhea - has to miss work 2 days per month due to pain. Pain begins 2-3 days before menses, peaks during period, rated 9/10 on worst days. Uses heating pad, takes ibuprofen 800mg every 6 hours with incomplete relief. Reports deep dyspareunia (pain with intercourse), especially with deep penetration. Pain persists after intercourse for hours. Also notes painful bowel movements around menses (dyschezia), occasional blood in stool during period. Low back pain radiating to thighs. Chronic fatigue attributed to pain and poor sleep.\n\nPrevious laparoscopy 3 years ago confirmed Stage III endometriosis - lesions ablated/excised. Improved for ~1 year, then symptoms returned. Tried continuous OCPs for 2 years with partial improvement, then lost effectiveness. Currently not on any hormonal therapy.\n\nFertility: Trying to conceive for 18 months without success. Partner has normal semen analysis.\n\nPast Medical History: Endometriosis (diagnosed age 35)\nPast Surgical History: Diagnostic laparoscopy with ablation (3 years ago)\nMedications: Ibuprofen PRN (frequent use)\nAllergies: No known drug allergies\nFamily History: Mother with endometriosis, hysterectomy at 42\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Blood Pressure: 118/74 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 76 bpm\n- Temperature: 98.4\u00b0F\n- BMI: 23 kg/m\u00b2\n\nPhysical Examination:\n- General: Appears fatigued, in mild discomfort\n- Abdomen: Soft, mild suprapubic tenderness, no masses\n- Pelvic Examination:\n  - External: Normal\n  - Vagina: Normal\n  - Cervix: Normal, no lesions\n  - Uterus:\n    - Retroverted, fixed (limited mobility - suggests adhesions)\n    - Enlarged, globular\n    - Tender to palpation, especially posterior\n    - Boggy consistency (adenomyosis)\n  - Adnexa: Left adnexal tenderness, no discrete mass\n  - Rectovaginal exam: Nodularity in cul-de-sac, uterosacral ligament tenderness bilaterally, rectovaginal nodule palpated (suggesting deep infiltrating endometriosis)\n  - Pain with cervical motion toward left\n\nImaging:\n- Transvaginal Ultrasound:\n  - Uterus: Enlarged 10 x 6 x 7 cm, globular contour\n  - Adenomyosis features:\n    - Heterogeneous myometrium\n    - Myometrial cysts\n    - Asymmetric myometrial thickening\n    - Poor demarcation of endo-myometrial junction\n  - No discrete fibroids\n  - Ovaries: Left ovary with 3 cm hypoechoic cyst with ground-glass appearance (endometrioma)\n  - Right ovary: Normal\n  - No free fluid\n\n- MRI Pelvis:\n  - Adenomyosis confirmed (diffuse junctional zone thickening >12mm)\n  - Left ovarian endometrioma 3.2 cm\n  - Deep infiltrating endometriosis:\n    - Rectovaginal nodule 1.5 cm\n    - Uterosacral ligament thickening bilaterally\n  - Cul-de-sac obliteration\n  - No bowel obstruction\n\nLaboratory:\n- CBC: Normal\n- CA-125: 45 U/mL (elevated - can be elevated in endometriosis, not diagnostic)\n- AMH (Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone): 1.8 ng/mL (diminished ovarian reserve for age 38)\n- FSH: 9 mIU/mL (day 3)\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnoses:\n1. Endometriosis, Stage III-IV (previously confirmed, recurrent) (ICD-10: N80.9)\n2. Adenomyosis (ICD-10: N80.00)\n3. Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis (DIE) - Rectovaginal (ICD-10: N80.4)\n4. Endometrioma, Left Ovary (ICD-10: N80.1)\n5. Infertility, Female (ICD-10: N97.9)\n6. Chronic Pelvic Pain (ICD-10: R10.2)\n\nComplexity:\n- Dual pathology: Endometriosis AND adenomyosis\n- Deep infiltrating disease involving rectovaginal septum\n- Failed conservative treatment (OCPs, NSAIDs)\n- Age 38 with diminished ovarian reserve - time-sensitive fertility\n- Endometrioma present (may impact egg retrieval)\n\n### Plan\nMultidisciplinary Approach Needed:\n1. Fertility specialist (Reproductive Endocrinologist) referral - URGENT given age and AMH\n2. Endometriosis/Minimally Invasive GYN Surgery specialist\n3. Potentially colorectal surgery if bowel involvement significant\n\nFertility Considerations (Priority Given Age):\n4. Time is critical: Age 38, AMH 1.8 = diminished reserve, fertility declining\n5. Do NOT delay fertility treatment for prolonged medical suppression\n6. IVF likely most efficient route given:\n   - Age\n   - Diminished reserve\n   - Endometrioma\n   - Prior surgery\n   - Failed spontaneous conception x 18 months\n7. Consider oocyte retrieval before surgery (if surgery planned)\n8. Endometrioma may require management before/with IVF:\n   - Small endometriomas (<4 cm): May proceed with IVF\n   - Risk of damaging ovarian reserve with cystectomy\n   - Discuss with REI\n\nSurgical Options:\n9. Expert excision surgery for deep endometriosis:\n   - Excision (not ablation) of deep lesions\n   - Rectovaginal nodule may require bowel shaving or partial resection\n   - Improve pain and possibly fertility\n   - Risk: Ovarian reserve damage, adhesions, bowel complications\n10. Adenomyosis: Surgery limited since definitive is hysterectomy\n    - If fertility not desired later: Hysterectomy curative\n    - Fertility-sparing: Adenomyomectomy (limited, risky)\n11. Endometrioma cystectomy: Only if symptomatic or affecting egg retrieval\n    - Risks reducing ovarian reserve further\n12. Consider surgery AFTER egg freezing or embryo creation\n\nMedical Management for Pain:\n13. GnRH agonist (Lupron) + add-back therapy:\n    - Creates medical menopause\n    - Reduces pain, shrinks implants temporarily\n    - Stops ovarian function (not for fertility)\n    - Use for 3-6 months max without add-back\n    - Add-back: Norethindrone 5 mg or low-dose estrogen/progestin\n14. GnRH antagonist (Elagolix/Orilissa):\n    - Oral medication\n    - Reduces pain\n    - Dose-dependent estrogen suppression\n    - Can use longer-term with add-back\n15. Progestins:\n    - Norethindrone acetate 5 mg continuous\n    - Dienogest (not available in US)\n    - Depo-Provera\n16. Mirena IUD:\n    - Helps with adenomyosis bleeding/pain\n    - Limited effect on deep endometriosis\n\nFor Adenomyosis Specifically:\n17. Mirena IUD effective for adenomyosis pain/bleeding\n18. GnRH agonists temporarily shrink adenomyotic uterus\n19. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) - rarely used, not if fertility desired\n20. Definitive: Hysterectomy (only after fertility complete)\n\nPain Management:\n21. NSAIDs: Continue but limit chronic use (GI, renal risks)\n22. Consider pelvic floor physical therapy (muscular component)\n23. TENS unit for pain\n24. Neuropathic pain component: Gabapentin or Duloxetine\n25. Psychology/pain clinic referral for chronic pain management\n26. Avoid opioids if possible\n\nInfertility Treatment Path:\n27. REI consultation urgently (within 2 weeks)\n28. Likely proceed to IVF given:\n    - Age 38\n    - AMH 1.8 (diminished)\n    - Stage III-IV endo\n    - Endometrioma\n    - Failed spontaneous conception\n29. May suppress with OCPs or GnRH agonist briefly before IVF cycle\n30. Consider frozen embryo transfer with GnRH agonist suppression\n\nLifestyle and Supportive:\n31. Anti-inflammatory diet (some evidence)\n32. Regular exercise\n33. Adequate sleep\n34. Stress reduction\n35. Support groups for endometriosis\n36. Endo-1 in 9 resources\n\nLong-Term Management:\n37. After childbearing complete: Consider hysterectomy for definitive cure of adenomyosis\n38. May conserve ovaries if endo controlled\n39. Endometriosis can recur even after menopause (rare)\n\nFollow-up:\n40. REI appointment within 1-2 weeks\n41. Endometriosis surgery specialist if proceeding surgically\n42. Discussion of IVF vs surgery first at multidisciplinary consultation\n43. Serial AMH monitoring\n44. Regular follow-up for pain management"

        "output": "### Subjective\nPatient is a 62-year-old G3P3003 presenting with vaginal dryness and painful intercourse (dyspareunia) for 2 years. Reports vaginal dryness is constant, with itching and burning. Intercourse has become very painful - has significantly reduced sexual activity with husband due to discomfort. Uses over-the-counter lubricants with temporary partial relief. Also reports urinary symptoms: urinary frequency (every 2 hours), urgency, occasional urge incontinence, and recurrent UTIs (3 in past year). Denies stress incontinence. Feels her symptoms are affecting quality of life and relationship.\n\nMenopause at age 52 (10 years ago). Never used hormone replacement therapy. No vaginal bleeding.\n\nPast Medical History: Hyperlipidemia, Osteopenia\nPast Surgical History: Tubal ligation\nMedications: Rosuvastatin 10mg, Calcium/Vitamin D\nAllergies: No known drug allergies\nFamily History: Mother with breast cancer at age 72\nSocial: Non-smoker, occasional wine, married, sexually active (limited by symptoms)\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Blood Pressure: 128/78 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 72 bpm\n- Temperature: 98.4\u00b0F\n- BMI: 25 kg/m\u00b2\n\nPhysical Examination:\n- General: Well-appearing, comfortable\n- External Genitalia:\n  - Sparse pubic hair\n  - Vulvar atrophy, pale thin skin\n  - Loss of labial fullness\n  - Reduced visibility of labia minora\n  - Introitus narrowed\n  - No lesions, no masses\n- Vagina:\n  - Atrophic mucosa: Pale, thin, dry, shiny\n  - Loss of rugae (smooth walls)\n  - Petechiae visible (fragile tissue)\n  - Minimal discharge (not the normal moist appearance)\n  - Bleeds easily with speculum insertion (friability)\n- Cervix: Atrophic, flush with vaginal wall\n- Uterus: Small, atrophic, non-tender\n- Adnexa: Not palpable, non-tender\n- Bladder: Non-tender, no prolapse\n- Pelvic floor: Good support, no significant prolapse\n\nUrethral exam: Caruncle visible (urethral prolapse/atrophy)\n\nOffice Testing:\n- Vaginal pH: 6.0 (elevated, normal premenopausal <4.5)\n- Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI): Low (increased parabasal cells, decreased superficial cells)\n- Wet mount: No infection, no yeast, no BV, reduced lactobacilli\n\nLaboratory:\n- Urinalysis: Trace WBCs, no bacteria, no blood\n- Urine culture: No growth (not current UTI)\n- Post-void residual: 20 mL (normal)\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) / Vulvovaginal Atrophy (ICD-10: N95.2)\n\nComponents Present:\n1. Vulvovaginal symptoms:\n   - Vaginal dryness \u2713\n   - Dyspareunia (painful intercourse) \u2713\n   - Vulvar irritation/burning \u2713\n   - Vaginal atrophy on exam \u2713\n2. Urinary symptoms:\n   - Frequency \u2713\n   - Urgency \u2713\n   - Recurrent UTIs \u2713\n   - Urethral atrophy \u2713\n\nPathophysiology:\n- Estrogen deficiency \u2192 Thinning of vaginal/urethral epithelium, loss of glycogen, reduced lactobacilli, elevated pH, decreased lubrication, tissue fragility\n\nBreast Cancer History (Family):\n- Mother at age 72: Moderate family history\n- NOT a contraindication to low-dose vaginal estrogen\n- Vaginal estrogen = minimal systemic absorption (safe in most patients)\n\n### Plan\nFirst-Line Treatment - Low-Dose Vaginal Estrogen (Most Effective):\n1. Vaginal estrogen therapy:\n   - Estradiol vaginal cream (Estrace): 0.5-1 g intravaginally nightly x 2 weeks, then 1-2x/week maintenance\n   - OR Estradiol vaginal tablet (Vagifem/Yuvafem): 10 mcg intravaginally nightly x 2 weeks, then twice weekly\n   - OR Estradiol vaginal ring (Estring): Insert vaginally, replace every 3 months\n   - OR Estradiol vaginal insert (Imvexxy): 4 mcg intravaginally nightly x 2 weeks, then twice weekly\n2. All options equally effective - choose based on patient preference and cost\n3. Vagifem tablet or Imvexxy insert: Easiest to use, less messy\n4. Ring: Convenient, once every 3 months, patient-placed\n5. Cream: Most affordable, can use on vulva as well\n\nCounseling on Vaginal Estrogen:\n6. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is LOCAL therapy\n7. Minimal systemic absorption (serum estrogen remains in postmenopausal range)\n8. FDA black box warning applies (same as systemic HRT) but clinical evidence supports safety\n9. No increased breast cancer risk with low-dose vaginal estrogen\n10. No endometrial protection with progestin needed for low-dose vaginal estrogen\n11. Mother's breast cancer at 72 is NOT contraindication\n12. Benefits far outweigh risks for this patient\n\nIf History of Breast Cancer or Strong Preference to Avoid Hormones:\n13. Non-hormonal options:\n    - Ospemifene (Osphena) 60 mg PO daily: SERM, not an estrogen\n    - Prasterone (Intrarosa) 6.5 mg vaginal insert nightly: DHEA (converts locally)\n    - These are alternatives if patient declines estrogen\n\nLubricants and Moisturizers (Adjunctive):\n14. Vaginal moisturizers (for dryness between intercourse):\n    - Replens, Revaree, or similar\n    - Use 2-3 times per week regularly\n    - Provides moisture, does not treat underlying atrophy\n15. Lubricants (for intercourse):\n    - Water-based: Astroglide, K-Y Jelly\n    - Silicone-based: Last longer, better for PIV intercourse\n    - Avoid petroleum-based with condoms\n16. Continue even with estrogen therapy for added comfort\n\nFor Urinary Symptoms:\n17. Vaginal estrogen treats urogenital atrophy (urethra responds too)\n18. Expect improvement in frequency, urgency, recurrent UTIs\n19. May take 4-12 weeks for full effect\n20. Recurrent UTIs: Vaginal estrogen reduces UTI recurrence by 50%\n21. If urinary symptoms persist: Formal urologic/urogynecologic evaluation\n\nBehavioral and Lifestyle:\n22. Regular sexual activity or vaginal dilator use helps maintain vaginal health\n23. Pelvic floor exercises (Kegels) for urinary symptoms\n24. Avoid irritants: Douches, scented products, harsh soaps\n25. Cotton underwear, loose clothing\n26. Adequate hydration (for urinary health)\n\nExpected Improvement Timeline:\n27. Some relief within 2-4 weeks\n28. Optimal improvement at 8-12 weeks\n29. Maintenance therapy is INDEFINITE - symptoms will return if stopped\n30. GSM is progressive without treatment\n\nMonitoring:\n31. Follow-up in 6-8 weeks to assess response\n32. No routine endometrial monitoring needed with low-dose vaginal estrogen\n33. Report any vaginal bleeding (postmenopausal bleeding always warrants workup)\n\nBreast Health:\n34. Continue routine mammography screening\n35. Family history noted - discuss any breast symptoms promptly\n36. Low-dose vaginal estrogen does not increase breast cancer risk\n\nBone Health (Separate Issue):\n37. Patient has osteopenia - continue calcium/vitamin D\n38. DEXA scan per screening schedule\n39. Vaginal estrogen does NOT provide systemic bone protection\n40. If systemic symptoms (hot flashes, bone protection needed): Could consider systemic HRT, but not indicated here\n\nPartner Communication:\n41. Discuss with partner that treatment takes time\n42. Gradual resumption of sexual activity as comfort improves\n43. Use lubricants during intercourse\n44. Consider couples counseling if intimacy affected\n\nFollow-up:\n45. Return in 6-8 weeks to assess response\n46. May adjust formulation if not improving or not tolerated\n47. Long-term use expected - annual follow-up once stable\n48. Report any bleeding, persistent symptoms, or concerns"

Patient is candidate for METHOTREXATE:\n   - Hemodynamically stable \u2713\n   - No contraindications to methotrexate \u2713\n   - No fetal cardiac activity on ultrasound \u2713\n   - Ectopic size <3.5 cm \u2713 (2.5 cm)\n   - \u03b2-hCG <5,000 mIU/mL \u2713 (2,850)\n   - Able to comply with follow-up \u2713\n\nMethotrexate Protocol:\n\n5. Pre-treatment labs (obtained):\n   - CBC: Normal \u2713\n   - CMP: Cr 0.8, LFTs normal \u2713\n   - Blood type: O positive \u2713\n   - Quantitative \u03b2-hCG: 2,850 \u2713\n\n6. Methotrexate dosing (single-dose protocol):\n   - Methotrexate 50 mg/m\u00b2 IM\n   - Calculate BSA: Patient 5'6\", 140 lbs \u2192 BSA ~1.7 m\u00b2\n   - Dose: 50 x 1.7 = 85 mg IM\n\n7. Administer: Methotrexate 85 mg IM today\n\n8. RhoGAM: Not needed (patient is Rh-positive)\n   - If Rh-negative: Would give RhoGAM 50-120 mcg IM\n\nPost-Methotrexate Monitoring:\n\n9. \u03b2-hCG monitoring:\n   - Day 1 (today): \u03b2-hCG 2,850 (baseline)\n   - Day 4: Repeat \u03b2-hCG (may initially rise, that's OK)\n   - Day 7: Repeat \u03b2-hCG - must decline \u226515% from Day 4\n   - Then weekly \u03b2-hCG until <5 mIU/mL (resolution)\n\n10. If Day 7 \u03b2-hCG does not decline \u226515% from Day 4:\n    - Consider second dose of methotrexate\n    - Or surgical intervention\n\n11. Typical time to resolution: 2-4 weeks (sometimes longer)\n\n12. During treatment:\n    - Mild abdominal pain Days 3-7 common (\"separation pain\") - NOT rupture\n    - Distinguish from severe pain (possible rupture)\n\nPrecautions and Restrictions:\n\n13. Avoid during methotrexate treatment:\n    - Sexual intercourse\n    - Vigorous exercise\n    - Alcohol\n    - Folic acid/prenatal vitamins (antagonizes methotrexate)\n    - NSAIDs (increase methotrexate toxicity)\n    - Sun exposure (photosensitivity)\n\n14. Resume prenatal vitamins after \u03b2-hCG negative\n\nWarning Signs - Go to ER Immediately:\n\n15. Signs of ruptured ectopic (emergency):\n    - Severe sudden abdominal pain\n    - Dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope\n    - Shoulder pain (referred from diaphragm irritation)\n    - Heavy vaginal bleeding\n    - Signs of shock: Rapid heart rate, pale, sweating\n\n16. Rupture is surgical emergency requiring immediate laparoscopy\n\nSurgical Option (If Methotrexate Fails or Contraindicated):\n\n17. Laparoscopy:\n    - Salpingostomy: Removes ectopic, preserves tube (for future fertility)\n    - Salpingectomy: Removes entire tube (if damaged or complete treatment desired)\n\n18. Indications for surgery instead of methotrexate:\n    - Hemodynamic instability (rupture)\n    - \u03b2-hCG >5,000 (relative)\n    - Fetal cardiac activity present\n    - Contraindications to methotrexate (liver/kidney disease, immunocompromise)\n    - Patient preference\n    - Failed methotrexate\n\nFuture Fertility Counseling:\n\n19. After ectopic pregnancy:\n    - Risk of future ectopic: ~15% (higher than general population)\n    - Early ultrasound confirmation in future pregnancies\n    - Fertility generally preserved with methotrexate treatment\n\n20. Contraception:\n    - Do NOT get pregnant for at least 3 months after methotrexate\n    - Methotrexate is teratogenic\n    - Use reliable contraception\n\nEmotional Support:\n\n21. Ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy loss\n22. Offer emotional support and resources\n23. Consider counseling referral if needed\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n24. Day 4: \u03b2-hCG level\n25. Day 7: \u03b2-hCG level (must decline \u226515% from Day 4)\n26. Then weekly until \u03b2-hCG <5\n27. Call or come in immediately if: Severe pain, bleeding, dizziness\n\nPatient Education:\n\n28. Methotrexate stops ectopic pregnancy from growing\n29. Takes weeks for hormone to go to zero\n30. Some cramping and spotting normal\n31. Severe pain = emergency\n32. Cannot try to get pregnant for 3 months\n33. Follow-up blood tests are critical"

Reports:\n- Heavy periods x 6 months, getting worse\n- Cycles: Irregular, every 2-6 weeks\n- Duration: Periods lasting 10-14 days (was 5 days previously)\n- Flow: Very heavy, soaking through pad/tampon every 1-2 hours on heavy days\n- Passing clots, some large\n- Fatigue, shortness of breath with exertion\n- No intermenstrual bleeding (bleeding only with periods, just very heavy)\n- No postcoital bleeding\n\nNo history of fibroids (never told). Last Pap smear 1 year ago, normal.\n\nPast Medical History: Hypertension, obesity\nMedications: Lisinopril 10 mg\nAllergies: NKDA\nSocial: Non-smoker, teacher, married, not sexually active frequently\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 128/82, HR 88, Weight 195 lbs, BMI 32\n\nGeneral: Fatigued-appearing, pale conjunctivae\n\nAbdomen: Soft, obese, non-tender, no masses\n\nPelvic Exam:\n- External: Normal\n- Vagina: Small amount of blood, no lesions\n- Cervix: Appears normal, no lesions, no cervical motion tenderness\n- Uterus: Mildly enlarged (~10-week size), irregular contour\n- Adnexa: No masses palpated\n\nLabs:\n- Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL (low, anemia)\n- Hematocrit: 30%\n- MCV: 78 fL (microcytic - iron deficiency)\n- Iron: 35 mcg/dL (low)\n- Ferritin: 8 ng/mL (very low)\n- TSH: 2.4 mIU/L (normal)\n- PT/INR: Normal\n- Pregnancy test: Negative\n\nTransvaginal Ultrasound:\n- Uterus: Enlarged, 12 x 8 x 7 cm\n- Endometrial thickness: 14 mm (thickened for age)\n- Fibroids: Multiple intramural fibroids, largest 4 cm posterior\n- No submucosal fibroids seen\n- Ovaries: Normal, some follicular activity (perimenopausal)\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB), Perimenopausal (ICD-10: N92.1)\n\nPALM-COEIN Classification:\n- Structural causes (PALM): Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma (fibroids), Malignancy\n- Non-structural (COEIN): Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, Endometrial, Iatrogenic, Not classified\n\nThis Patient:\n- Leiomyomas (fibroids) - present \u2713\n- Ovulatory dysfunction (perimenopausal) - likely \u2713\n- Thickened endometrium - needs evaluation\n- Anemia from chronic blood loss \u2713\n\n### Plan\nFurther Evaluation:\n\n1. Endometrial biopsy (EMB) - INDICATED:\n   - Age >45 with AUB\n   - Thickened endometrium (14 mm)\n   - Risk factors: Obesity, irregular cycles, anovulation\n   - Rule out: Endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma\n\n2. Perform office endometrial biopsy (Pipelle)\n   - Can be done today if not actively bleeding heavily\n   - Tissue sent to pathology\n\n3. Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS):\n   - If suspicion for polyp or submucosal fibroid\n   - Better delineates uterine cavity than standard ultrasound\n   - Order if EMB non-diagnostic or cavity evaluation needed\n\n4. Hysteroscopy:\n   - If EMB inadequate or for direct visualization\n   - Can be diagnostic and therapeutic (polypectomy)\n\nAnemia Treatment:\n\n5. Iron deficiency anemia from chronic blood loss:\n   - Hemoglobin 9.8, ferritin 8 (depleted stores)\n\n6. Iron supplementation:\n   - Ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg elemental iron) daily or BID\n   - Take with vitamin C (enhances absorption)\n   - Take on empty stomach if tolerated (otherwise with food)\n   - Side effects: Constipation, GI upset, dark stools\n\n7. Prescribe: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg BID with vitamin C\n\n8. If severe anemia or not tolerating oral: Consider IV iron (iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose)\n\n9. Recheck CBC in 6-8 weeks (expect Hgb increase of 1-2 g/dL in 4 weeks)\n\nBleeding Control (While Awaiting Biopsy Results):\n\n10. Hormonal options (if biopsy rules out malignancy):\n    - Progestins: Medroxyprogesterone 10 mg daily x 10-14 days/month\n    - Combined OCP (if no contraindications)\n    - Progestin-releasing IUD (Mirena) - excellent for AUB\n\n11. Non-hormonal option:\n    - Tranexamic acid 1300 mg TID during heavy bleeding days (antifibrinolytic)\n    - Reduces bleeding by 30-50%\n    - Do not use with hormonal contraceptives\n\n12. Immediate control if actively bleeding heavily:\n    - High-dose progestin: Medroxyprogesterone 20 mg TID x 7 days\n    - Or: OCP (if eligible) every 8 hours x 3 days, then daily\n\n13. Prescribe for now: Tranexamic acid 1300 mg, take 2 tabs TID during heavy bleeding (max 5 days per cycle)\n\nFibroid Management:\n\n14. Fibroids contributing to heavy bleeding:\n    - Currently intramural (not submucosal on US)\n    - Submucosal fibroids more likely to cause bleeding\n    - May consider treatment if medical management fails\n\n15. Fibroid treatment options (if needed):\n    - Medical: GnRH agonists (temporary), ulipristal (not in US)\n    - Procedural: Uterine artery embolization (UAE)\n    - Surgical: Myomectomy, hysterectomy\n\nBased on Endometrial Biopsy Results:\n\n16. If benign (proliferative/secretory endometrium):\n    - Proceed with medical management\n    - LNG-IUD (Mirena) excellent choice\n    - Progestins cyclically\n\n17. If endometrial hyperplasia WITHOUT atypia:\n    - Progestin therapy (Mirena IUD or oral progestins)\n    - Repeat EMB in 3-6 months\n\n18. If endometrial hyperplasia WITH atypia or carcinoma:\n    - GYN oncology referral\n    - Hysterectomy usually indicated\n    - Staging if carcinoma\n\nLong-Term Management:\n\n19. Given perimenopause and heavy bleeding:\n    - LNG-IUD (Mirena) is excellent first-line:\n      - Thins endometrium\n      - Reduces bleeding significantly\n      - Provides contraception\n      - Can use through menopause\n\n20. If medical management fails or not desired:\n    - Endometrial ablation (if childbearing complete)\n    - Hysterectomy (definitive)\n\n21. Perimenopausal counseling:\n    - Cycles will remain irregular until menopause\n    - Menopause average age 51 (patient is 52)\n    - Still need contraception until 12 months without period\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n22. Await endometrial biopsy results (1-2 weeks)\n\n23. Return in 2 weeks:\n    - Review EMB results\n    - Discuss treatment plan based on results\n    - Assess response to iron and bleeding control\n\n24. Consider GYN referral if:\n    - Atypical hyperplasia or malignancy\n    - Surgical management needed\n    - Failed medical management\n\nPatient Education:\n\n25. Heavy bleeding causing anemia - need to treat both\n26. Biopsy important to rule out serious problems\n27. Most causes of perimenopausal bleeding are benign\n28. Multiple treatment options available\n29. Call if: Heavy bleeding soaking >1 pad/hour, dizziness, chest pain (severe anemia)"

If non-albicans or resistant species:\n   - Boric acid 600 mg vaginal suppository nightly x 14 days\n   - Topical nystatin\n   - Flucytosine cream\n   - Adjust based on sensitivities\n\nRule Out Underlying Conditions:\n\n10. Diabetes screening:\n    - Fasting glucose or HbA1c (uncontrolled diabetes predisposes to yeast)\n    - Order: HbA1c\n\n11. HIV testing:\n    - RVVC can be sign of immunosuppression\n    - Offer HIV test (routine anyway for sexually active adults)\n\n12. If HbA1c elevated: Address diabetes\n13. If HIV positive: Refer for treatment\n\nLifestyle Modifications:\n\n14. Avoid irritants:\n    - No douching\n    - Avoid scented soaps, feminine sprays, bubble baths\n    - Unscented, mild soap for external area only\n\n15. Clothing:\n    - Wear breathable cotton underwear\n    - Avoid tight-fitting clothes\n    - Change out of wet swimsuits/workout clothes promptly\n\n16. Diet:\n    - Some evidence that reducing sugar intake may help\n    - Probiotics (oral or vaginal) - modest evidence, may try\n\n17. Partner treatment:\n    - NOT routinely recommended\n    - Yeast is not considered an STI\n    - Partner treatment only if partner is symptomatic (balanitis)\n\n18. Avoid unnecessary antibiotics (can trigger yeast)\n\nSymptom Relief:\n\n19. For external itching:\n    - Topical antifungal cream (clotrimazole 1%) to vulva\n    - Hydrocortisone 1% cream (short-term, 2-3 days max)\n    - Cool compresses\n    - Avoid scratching\n\n20. Sitz baths with plain water can soothe irritation\n\nMonitoring:\n\n21. During maintenance therapy:\n    - Monitor for hepatotoxicity (rare) if prolonged fluconazole\n    - LFTs at baseline and periodically (every 3 months)\n    - Symptoms of liver problems: Jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain\n\n22. Drug interactions: Fluconazole interacts with many medications\n    - Currently on no medications, so OK\n\nRefractory Cases:\n\n23. If symptoms persist despite appropriate treatment:\n    - Confirm diagnosis (re-culture, ensure it's yeast)\n    - Consider non-albicans species\n    - Consider other diagnoses (contact dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, etc.)\n\n24. If non-albicans confirmed:\n    - Boric acid vaginal suppositories 600 mg nightly x 14 days (maintenance: twice weekly)\n    - Compounded - prescribe through compounding pharmacy\n    - Toxic if ingested - vaginal use only\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n25. Return in 2 weeks:\n    - Confirm resolution of current episode\n    - Review culture results\n    - Begin maintenance therapy\n    - Review HbA1c, HIV results\n\n26.

Signs to watch for (come in or call):\n    - Severe abdominal pain (perforation, infection)\n    - Heavy bleeding or abnormal discharge (infection)\n    - Fever (infection)\n    - Can feel hard plastic of IUD (expulsion)\n    - Missing strings (expulsion or perforation)\n    - Positive pregnancy test (IUD failure, ectopic risk)\n\nRisks Discussed:\n\n12. Perforation: Rare (~1/1000), occurs during insertion\n13. Expulsion: 2-10%, higher in nulliparous, in first 3 months\n14. Infection/PID: Slightly increased risk in first 20 days, then no increased risk\n15. IUD failure (pregnancy): <1% (highly effective)\n16. If pregnancy occurs with IUD: Higher risk of ectopic - must evaluate\n\nBenefits:\n\n17. Highly effective (>99%)\n18. Long-acting, reversible\n19. \"Set it and forget it\" - no daily action needed\n20. Hormonal IUDs reduce menstrual bleeding and cramps\n21. Fertility returns immediately after removal\n22. Can be used by nulliparous women (safe and effective)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n23. String check visit: 4-6 weeks after insertion\n    - Confirm strings visible\n    - Ensure no signs of infection or expulsion\n    - Address any concerns\n\n24. After initial check:\n    - Annual well-woman exams\n    - No routine ultrasound needed unless symptoms\n\n25.

Reports:\n- Trying to conceive (TTC) x 14 months without success\n- Regular cycles every 28-30 days\n- Uses ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) - positive surge detected monthly\n- Timed intercourse around ovulation\n- No prior pregnancies\n- Partner: 40-year-old male, healthy, no children from prior relationships\n\nMenstrual history:\n- Menarche age 12\n- Regular periods\n- Moderate flow, 5 days duration\n- No severe dysmenorrhea\n\nPast Medical History: None\nSurgical History: Appendectomy age 16\nMedications: Prenatal vitamin, folic acid\nAllergies: NKDA\nFamily History: Mother had difficulty conceiving (took 3 years)\n\nNo history of: PID, STIs, fibroids, endometriosis (that she knows of)\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 118/74, HR 70, Weight 155 lbs, BMI 25\n\nThyroid: Normal, no enlargement\n\nBreasts: Normal, no galactorrhea\n\nAbdomen: Soft, non-tender, no masses\n\nPelvic Exam:\n- External: Normal\n- Vagina: Normal\n- Cervix: Parous appearance, no lesions\n- Uterus: Normal size, anteverted, mobile, non-tender\n- Adnexa: No masses, non-tender\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Female Infertility, Primary (ICD-10: N97.9)\n\nDefinition: Infertility = inability to conceive after 12 months of regular unprotected intercourse\n- Patient meets criteria (14 months TTC)\n- At age 38, evaluation should begin after 6 months (age-related decline)\n\nFactors to Evaluate:\n1. Ovulatory function\n2. Tubal patency\n3. Uterine cavity\n4. Ovarian reserve (age-related, especially important at 38)\n5. Male factor (partner evaluation)\n\n### Plan\nInfertility Workup:\n\n1. Ovulatory Assessment:\n\n   a) Patient using OPKs with positive surge - suggests ovulation occurring\n   \n   b) Day 21 progesterone (mid-luteal phase):\n      - Confirms ovulation occurred\n      - Order: Serum progesterone on cycle day 21 (7 days post-ovulation)\n      - Level >3 ng/mL confirms ovulation\n   \n   c) TSH: Thyroid dysfunction can cause anovulation\n   \n   d) Prolactin: Hyperprolactinemia can cause anovulation\n\n2. Ovarian Reserve Testing (Critical at Age 38):\n\n   a) AMH (Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone):\n      - Can be drawn any time in cycle\n      - Reflects ovarian follicle pool\n      - Normal: >1.0 ng/mL (varies by lab)\n      - Low reserve: <1.0 ng/mL\n      - Very low: <0.5 ng/mL\n   \n   b) Day 3 FSH and Estradiol:\n      - Draw on cycle day 2-4\n      - FSH >10 mIU/mL suggests diminished reserve\n      - Estradiol >80 pg/mL on day 3 may falsely lower FSH (caution)\n   \n   c) Antral follicle count (AFC):\n      - Transvaginal ultrasound on cycle days 2-5\n      - Count small follicles (2-10 mm) in both ovaries\n      - Normal: Total AFC 10-20\n      - Low: <6\n\n3. Tubal Patency Assessment:\n\n   a) Hysterosalpingogram (HSG):\n      - Gold standard for tubal evaluation\n      - Schedule cycle days 6-12 (after menses, before ovulation)\n      - Contrast injected through cervix, X-ray imaging\n      - Shows tubal patency (spill) and uterine cavity\n      - Can be therapeutic (oil-based contrast may improve fertility)\n   \n   b) Order: HSG (radiology)\n   \n   c) Pre-procedure: Ibuprofen 600-800 mg 1 hour before, +/- doxycycline prophylaxis\n\n4. Uterine Cavity Evaluation:\n\n   a) HSG will show gross abnormalities\n   \n   b) Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS):\n      - If HSG abnormal or need better cavity detail\n      - Visualizes polyps, fibroids, adhesions\n   \n   c) Hysteroscopy: Direct visualization if needed\n\n5. Male Factor Evaluation (CRITICAL - 40% of infertility involves male factor):\n\n   a) Semen analysis:\n      - Most important male test\n      - Partner should have semen analysis\n      - Abstain 2-5 days before collection\n      - Evaluates: Volume, count, motility, morphology\n   \n   b) Order: Semen analysis for partner\n   \n   c) WHO reference values:\n      - Volume \u22651.5 mL\n      - Concentration \u226515 million/mL\n      - Motility \u226540% total, \u226532% progressive\n      - Morphology \u22654% normal forms\n   \n   d) If abnormal: Repeat in 2-4 weeks (variability), then urology referral\n\nAdditional Labs:\n\n6. Order:\n   - TSH\n   - Prolactin\n   - AMH (any cycle day)\n   - Day 3 FSH, estradiol (cycle day 2-4)\n   - Day 21 progesterone (cycle day 21)\n   - CBC, CMP (general health)\n   - Rubella immunity, varicella immunity (pre-conception)\n   - Blood type and Rh\n   - STI screening (GC/chlamydia) - important before invasive tests\n\nImaging:\n\n7. Transvaginal ultrasound (cycle days 2-5):\n   - Antral follicle count\n   - Uterine anatomy (fibroids, polyps)\n   - Ovarian morphology\n\n8. HSG: Schedule after menses\n\nAge-Related Counseling:\n\n9. At age 38:\n   - Ovarian reserve declines significantly\n   - Egg quality decreases (higher aneuploidy rate)\n   - Time is important - expedite workup\n   - May need to consider assisted reproductive technology (ART) sooner\n   - IVF success rates decline with age\n\n10. If ovarian reserve diminished:\n    - Discuss IVF sooner rather than later\n    - Consider egg freezing if not ready for pregnancy (less applicable here)\n    - Donor eggs as option if own eggs not viable\n\nLifestyle Optimization:\n\n11. Continue prenatal vitamins and folic acid\n12. Maintain healthy weight (BMI 25 is good)\n13. Limit alcohol and caffeine\n14. No smoking (neither partner)\n15. Regular exercise but not excessive\n16. Manage stress\n17. Optimize intercourse timing (every 1-2 days around ovulation)\n\nReferral:\n\n18. Given age 38 and 14 months TTC:\n    - Consider REI (reproductive endocrinology and infertility) referral\n    - Specialist can expedite workup and treatment\n    - Earlier intervention may be beneficial\n\n19. Refer to REI after initial workup complete or in parallel\n\nTreatment Options (Based on Findings):\n\n20. Unexplained infertility:\n    - Timed intercourse with ovulation monitoring\n    - Clomiphene citrate or letrozole (ovulation induction)\n    - IUI (intrauterine insemination)\n    - IVF (in vitro fertilization)\n\n21. Tubal factor:\n    - IVF (bypasses tubes)\n    - Tubal surgery (less common now)\n\n22. Male factor:\n    - IUI if mild\n    - IVF with ICSI if severe\n\n23. Diminished ovarian reserve:\n    - Aggressive treatment (IVF) sooner\n    - Consider donor eggs if needed\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n24. Return after labs and tests complete (approximately 1 cycle):\n    - Day 3 labs\n    - Day 21 progesterone\n    - HSG\n    - Partner semen analysis\n    - AFC ultrasound\n\n25. Review all results and discuss next steps\n\n26. Likely REI referral for treatment initiation\n\nEmotional Support:\n\n27. Infertility is stressful - acknowledge this\n28. Support groups and counseling available\n29. Partner involvement in all appointments when possible\n30. Answer questions at each visit\n\nPatient Education:\n\n31. Workup typically takes 1-2 months to complete\n32. 85% of couples have identifiable cause\n33. Many treatment options available\n34. Age is important factor - we will move efficiently\n35. Both partners need evaluation"

Labs: CBC, CMP, LFTs (baseline before chemo)\n\n12. Dental evaluation: Address any dental issues before starting\n\nSurgery (After Neoadjuvant Therapy):\n\n13. Restage after neoadjuvant chemo (MRI, exam)\n14. Surgical options:\n    - Lumpectomy (breast conservation) if good response\n    - Mastectomy if preferred or indicated\n    - Sentinel lymph node biopsy if node normalizes\n    - Axillary dissection if node still positive\n\n15. Surgical oncology consultation\n\nRadiation (After Surgery):\n\n16. Radiation typically indicated:\n    - After lumpectomy (whole breast radiation)\n    - After mastectomy if positive nodes or large tumor\n    - Regional nodal irradiation for node-positive disease\n\n17. Radiation oncology consultation after surgery\n\nAdjuvant Therapy:\n\n18. If pathological complete response (pCR) at surgery:\n    - Continue pembrolizumab adjuvant x 9 cycles total\n    - Good prognosis\n\n19. If residual disease at surgery (no pCR):\n    - Capecitabine 6-8 cycles adjuvant\n    - Continue pembrolizumab\n    - If BRCA+: Consider olaparib adjuvant\n\nSupportive Care During Chemotherapy:\n\n20.

Low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy alone: Usually for low risk only\n14. High-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost + EBRT: Option for intermediate risk\n15. Discuss with radiation oncology\n\nPatient Preferences:\n\n16. Discussion with patient:\n    - Goals: Cancer control vs quality of life\n    - Concerns about surgery vs radiation\n    - Sexual function importance\n    - Activity level and recovery time\n\n17. Patient preference today: Leaning toward robot-assisted prostatectomy\n\nPre-Operative Planning (If Surgery):\n\n18. Urology/surgical oncology referral\n19. Pre-operative evaluation:\n    - Medical clearance (cardiac, pulmonary if needed)\n    - Labs: CBC, CMP, coagulation\n    - Type and screen\n\n20. Discuss:\n    - Nerve-sparing procedure (if oncologically safe)\n    - Recovery: Catheter 1-2 weeks, return to activity 4-6 weeks\n\nAdjuvant Treatment Considerations:\n\n21. After surgery, if high-risk features found:\n    - Positive margins\n    - Extracapsular extension\n    - Seminal vesicle invasion\n    - Positive lymph nodes\n\n22. May need:\n    - Adjuvant or salvage radiation\n    - +/- ADT\n\nPost-Treatment Monitoring:\n\n23. PSA monitoring:\n    - After surgery: PSA should be undetectable (<0.1)\n    - Every 3-6 months for 2 years, then every 6-12 months\n    - PSA >0.2 = biochemical recurrence\n\n24. After radiation: PSA nadir + rise = recurrence\n\nSexual Function:\n\n25. Discuss preoperatively:\n    - Baseline erectile function\n    - Nerve-sparing intent (bilateral if oncologically safe)\n    - Erectile rehabilitation post-surgery: PDE5 inhibitors, vacuum devices, penile injections if needed\n\n26. Referral to sexual health if needed\n\nMultidisciplinary Discussion:\n\n27. Consider tumor board presentation\n28. Urology + radiation oncology + medical oncology input\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n29. Urology consultation for surgical planning\n30. Radiation oncology consultation for comparison\n31. Patient to decide after consultations\n32. Schedule surgery or start radiation within 6-8 weeks\n\nPatient Education:\n\n33. Intermediate-risk prostate cancer is curable\n34. Both surgery and radiation have excellent long-term outcomes\n35. Side effects differ - personal preference matters\n36. Whichever treatment chosen, regular follow-up is essential\n37. Life expectancy is good with treatment"

Germline genetic testing:\n   - Family history of colon cancer (father at 62)\n   - Consider Lynch syndrome testing\n   - Genetic counseling referral\n\nSurgery (Primary Treatment for Localized Colon Cancer):\n\n6. Surgical resection is primary treatment for non-metastatic colon cancer\n\n7. Surgical plan:\n   - Sigmoid colectomy with en bloc lymph node resection\n   - Minimum 12 lymph nodes for adequate staging\n   - Primary anastomosis if possible\n\n8. Surgical approaches:\n   - Laparoscopic/robotic (preferred if feasible)\n   - Open if necessary\n\n9. No neoadjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer (unlike rectal cancer)\n   - Surgery first, then adjuvant therapy based on pathology\n\n10. Colorectal surgery referral - urgent\n\nPre-Operative Preparation:\n\n11. Pre-operative clearance:\n    - Medical clearance (cardiac risk assessment)\n    - Diabetes optimization (good glucose control)\n    - Anemia: Consider iron supplementation, may need transfusion perioperatively\n\n12. Bowel preparation: Per surgeon protocol\n\n13. DVT prophylaxis perioperatively\n\nAdjuvant Chemotherapy (Post-Surgery):\n\n14. Stage III colon cancer: Adjuvant chemotherapy indicated\n\n15. Regimens:\n    - FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) x 6 months\n    - Or CAPOX (capecitabine + oxaliplatin) x 3-6 months\n\n16. Duration:\n    - 6 months was standard\n    - 3 months may be adequate for low-risk stage III (T1-3N1)\n    - Based on IDEA trial\n\n17. Decision after final pathology:\n    - Number of positive nodes\n    - T stage\n    - High-risk features\n\n18. MSI-high tumors:\n    - May have better prognosis\n    - Possibly less benefit from 5-FU\n    - Consider immunotherapy if metastatic (but for stage III, still give chemo)\n\nAnemia:\n\n19. Hemoglobin 10.5 - iron deficiency from chronic GI blood loss\n20. Iron supplementation: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily\n21. May need IV iron or transfusion perioperatively\n\nCEA:\n\n22. CEA elevated at 18 ng/mL\n23. Tumor marker for monitoring\n24. Recheck post-surgery (should normalize)\n25. Use for surveillance (rising CEA may indicate recurrence)\n\nSupportive Care:\n\n26. Nutrition: Optimize pre-surgery\n27. Glucose control for diabetic patient\n28. Smoking/alcohol: Patient non-smoker, occasional alcohol - OK\n29. Activity: Stay active as tolerated\n\nMultidisciplinary Tumor Board:\n\n30. Present case at tumor board:\n    - Colorectal surgery\n    - Medical oncology\n    - Radiation oncology (less relevant for colon vs rectal)\n    - Radiology\n    - Pathology\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n31. Colorectal surgery consultation this week\n32. Genetic counseling for Lynch syndrome evaluation\n33. Medical oncology: Post-surgery for adjuvant therapy\n\nPost-Treatment Surveillance (After Adjuvant Therapy):\n\n34. CEA every 3-6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 more years\n35. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis annually x 3-5 years\n36. Colonoscopy at 1 year post-surgery, then per findings\n37. History and physical every 3-6 months initially\n\nPatient Education:\n\n38. Colon cancer is curable with surgery and chemotherapy\n39. Stage III has good outcomes with treatment (5-year survival ~60-80%)\n40. Surgery will remove the cancer; chemotherapy reduces recurrence risk\n41. Family members should be screened (colonoscopy starting age 48 or 10 years before your diagnosis, whichever earlier)"

Axillary Staging:\n   - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) at time of surgery\n   - If SLNB negative: No axillary dissection needed\n   - If SLNB positive: Discuss ALND vs. radiation (Z0011 criteria)\n\n**NEOADJUVANT vs. ADJUVANT THERAPY:**\n\n8. Systemic Therapy Timing (Medical Oncology Decision):\n   \n   Neoadjuvant (Before Surgery):\n   - Considered for: Locally advanced, inflammatory, HER2+, triple-negative\n   - Advantages: Downstage tumor, assess response, pathologic complete response (pCR) = good prognosis\n\n   Adjuvant (After Surgery):\n   - Traditional approach for early-stage\n   - Based on final surgical pathology\n\n   For T2N0 IDC: Either approach reasonable, depends on receptor status\n   - If HER2+ or triple-negative: Neoadjuvant often preferred\n   - If ER+/HER2-: Adjuvant often preferred\n\n**ANTICIPATED ADJUVANT THERAPY (Pending Receptors):**\n\n9. If ER+/PR+/HER2- (Hormone Receptor Positive):\n   - Endocrine therapy x 5-10 years:\n     - Aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole) - postmenopausal\n     - OR Tamoxifen\n   - Chemotherapy decision: Based on Oncotype DX score\n     - Low recurrence score: Endocrine therapy alone\n     - High recurrence score: Add chemotherapy\n   - CDK4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib) if high-risk features\n\n10. If HER2+:\n    - Anti-HER2 therapy: Trastuzumab (Herceptin) + Pertuzumab\n    - Duration: 1 year\n    - Usually with chemotherapy (taxane-based)\n    - Neoadjuvant often preferred\n\n11. If Triple-Negative:\n    - Chemotherapy (anthracycline + taxane based)\n    - Consider immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) if eligible\n    - Neoadjuvant often preferred\n\n**RADIATION THERAPY:**\n\n12. If Lumpectomy: Whole breast radiation (required)\n    - +/- boost to tumor bed\n    - Regional nodal radiation if node-positive\n\n13. If Mastectomy: Post-mastectomy radiation if:\n    - Positive lymph nodes\n    - Large primary tumor\n    - Close margins\n\n**SUPPORTIVE CARE:**\n\n14. Psychosocial Support:\n    - Cancer diagnosis is overwhelming\n    - Social work referral\n    - Support groups for breast cancer\n    - Psychology/psychiatry if significant distress\n\n15. Fertility Counseling (if applicable):\n    - Patient is postmenopausal - not applicable\n    - For premenopausal: Discuss fertility preservation before chemo\n\n16.

For 45yo recreational athlete: Autograft preferred (BTB or hamstring)\n18. Discuss graft options, risks, expected recovery\n\nNon-Operative Option (If Patient Declines Surgery):\n19. Some patients can function without ACL (\"copers\")\n20. Requirements: Modify activity, no pivoting sports, aggressive PT\n21. Risk: Recurrent instability, meniscal tears, early arthritis\n22. Not recommended for active patients wanting to return to pivoting sports\n\nOrthopedic Surgery Referral:\n23. Refer to sports medicine orthopedic surgeon for ACL reconstruction\n24. Appointment within 1-2 weeks\n25. Bring MRI images to consultation\n\nPost-Operative Rehabilitation (Preview):\n26. After ACL reconstruction:\n    - Phase 1 (0-2 weeks): Protect graft, reduce swelling, restore extension\n    - Phase 2 (2-6 weeks): Progress ROM, begin strengthening\n    - Phase 3 (6-12 weeks): Progressive strengthening, proprioception\n    - Phase 4 (3-6 months): Sport-specific training begins\n    - Return to sport: 9-12 months post-op (with clearance testing)\n27. Full compliance with PT is critical for success\n\nReturn to Activity:\n28. Return to basketball: Typically 9-12 months after ACL reconstruction\n29. Criteria for return: Strength >90% of contralateral, passed functional tests\n30. Brace for sport: Optional, per surgeon preference\n31. Risk of re-rupture: ~5-10% (higher in younger patients, early return)\n\nWork/Disability:\n32. Sedentary work (accountant): Return in 1-2 weeks post-op with restrictions\n33. Physical labor: 4-6 months depending on demands\n34. Driving: When off narcotics and have good leg control (~2-4 weeks)\n\nFollow-up:\n35. Orthopedic surgery consultation within 1-2 weeks\n36.

Most disc herniations (~90%) improve with conservative care\n2. Initial trial of conservative management for 6-8 weeks unless progressive weakness\n\nActivity Modification:\n3. Avoid aggravating activities: Prolonged sitting, bending, heavy lifting\n4. Positions of comfort: Lying with knees bent, walking short distances\n5. NOT strict bed rest (bed rest >2-3 days is harmful)\n6. Gentle walking as tolerated\n\nPhysical Therapy:\n7. PT referral for:\n   - McKenzie method/directional preference exercises\n   - Core stabilization\n   - Nerve glides/neural mobilization\n   - Posture education\n8. Avoid PT modalities that flex spine (may worsen)\n9. Goal: Centralization of symptoms (pain moving from leg toward back = good sign)\n\nPharmacological Management:\n10. NSAIDs: Continue ibuprofen 600 mg TID with food (or switch to naproxen if preferred)\n    - Use gastroprotection if prolonged use (PPI)\n11. Muscle relaxant: Cyclobenzaprine 10 mg TID PRN for spasm\n12. Neuropathic pain:\n    - Gabapentin 300 mg TID, titrate up to 900-1800 mg/day as tolerated\n    - OR Pregabalin 75 mg BID, titrate up\n13. Oral corticosteroid taper (short course):\n    - Prednisone 60 mg x 2 days, 40 mg x 2 days, 20 mg x 2 days\n    - May provide short-term relief\n14. Opioids: Avoid if possible; short course only for severe pain unresponsive to above\n\nEpidural Steroid Injection:\n15. Consider if not improving after 2-4 weeks of conservative care\n16. Transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L5-S1 (targeting S1 root)\n17. Can provide 50% or more pain relief in many patients\n18. May need 1-3 injections (spaced 2-4 weeks apart)\n19. Refer to pain management or spine interventionalist\n\nSurgical Consultation Indications:\n20. URGENT surgical referral if:\n    - Cauda equina syndrome (emergency): Saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder dysfunction, bilateral weakness\n    - Progressive motor weakness (current 4/5 \u2192 3/5 or worse)\n    - Foot drop developing\n21. Elective surgical referral if:\n    - Failure of 6-8 weeks conservative management\n    - Persistent severe radiculopathy affecting function\n    - Patient preference after informed discussion\n\nSurgical Options (If Needed):\n22. Microdiscectomy:\n    - Gold standard for single-level disc herniation\n    - ~85-90% success rate for leg pain relief\n    - Outpatient surgery, quick recovery (2-4 weeks for sedentary work)\n23. Less invasive alternatives being studied but microdiscectomy remains standard\n\nMonitoring for Red Flags:\n24. Return IMMEDIATELY if:\n    - Saddle anesthesia (numbness in groin/buttocks)\n    - Loss of bowel control (incontinence)\n    - Bladder retention or incontinence\n    - Rapidly progressive weakness in legs\n    - Bilateral leg symptoms\n25. These indicate cauda equina syndrome \u2192 surgical emergency\n\nWeight Management:\n26. Weight loss counseling (BMI 32)\n27. Excess weight increases disc loading\n28. Dietitian referral if interested\n\nErgonomics:\n29. Proper lifting technique\n30. Lumbar support when sitting\n31. Avoid prolonged sitting (take breaks every 30-60 minutes)\n32. Standing desk option if working at computer\n\nFollow-up:\n33. Recheck in 2-3 weeks to assess response\n34. Sooner if worsening weakness or new symptoms\n35. If improving: Continue conservative care\n36. If not improving: Consider epidural injection, surgical consult\n37. Expect gradual improvement over 6-12 weeks with conservative care"

NPO for surgery\n2. IV access, IV fluids (NS or LR at maintenance)\n3. Pain management:\n   - IV morphine 2-4 mg q2-4h PRN OR\n   - IV hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg q2-4h PRN\n   - Consider fascia iliaca block for superior pain control\n4. Foley catheter (patient will go to OR)\n5. Type and screen (completed) - have blood available\n6. Admission to orthopedic surgery service\n\nAnticoagulation Reversal:\n7. INR 2.8 - too high for surgery\n8. Reversal options:\n   - Vitamin K 5-10 mg IV (takes 6-12 hours to work)\n   - 4-Factor PCC (Kcentra) for rapid reversal if surgery cannot wait\n   - FFP (less preferred - volume, slower)\n9. Target INR <1.5 for surgery\n10. Give Vitamin K 10 mg IV now\n11. Recheck INR in 6 hours\n12. If need faster reversal, give 4-factor PCC\n13. Hold warfarin\n\nDVT Prophylaxis:\n14. Mechanical: SCDs to left leg (right leg injured)\n15. Chemical: Hold anticoagulation perioperatively, restart postop per protocol\n\nPreoperative Workup:\n16. Labs obtained (CBC, BMP, coagulation studies, type and screen)\n17. EKG: AFib, no acute changes\n18. Chest X-ray: Clear\n19. Medical clearance: May need medicine or cardiology consult given AFib, age\n20. Anesthesia consult for operative planning\n21. Risk stratification: High-risk surgery in elderly patient\n\nOrthopedic Surgery Plan:\n22. DISPLACED femoral neck fracture in elderly \u2192 Arthroplasty (not internal fixation)\n23. Options:\n    - Hemiarthroplasty (replacement of femoral head only):\n      - Appropriate for lower-demand patients, cognitive impairment, limited life expectancy\n      - Faster surgery, less blood loss\n    - Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA):\n      - Appropriate for active, cognitively intact patients with longer life expectancy\n      - Better functional outcomes, lower reoperation rate\n      - This patient: Likely THA candidate (active at baseline)\n24. Surgical timing: Within 24-48 hours (early surgery reduces mortality)\n25. Delay only for anticoagulation reversal and medical optimization\n\nNon-Displaced Femoral Neck Fracture (for reference):\n26. If non-displaced (Garden I-II): Internal fixation (cannulated screws) may be attempted\n27. This patient has DISPLACED fracture \u2192 arthroplasty indicated\n\nMedical Optimization:\n28. Continue home medications except warfarin\n29. Hold metoprolol if hypotensive\n30. Stress dose steroids not needed (not on chronic steroids)\n31. Glycemic control if diabetic\n32. Optimize fluid status\n\nGeriatric/Medical Consult:\n33. Co-management with geriatrics or internal medicine\n34. Reduces complications and mortality in hip fracture patients\n35. Delirium prevention:\n    - Minimize sedatives\n    - Frequent reorientation\n    - Early mobilization postop\n    - Avoid Foley if possible postop\n    - Adequate pain control\n\nFall Evaluation:\n36. Mechanical fall (tripped on rug)\n37. No syncope, no cardiac symptoms\n38. Evaluate for contributing factors:\n    - Vision\n    - Medications (metoprolol can cause dizziness)\n    - Home safety\n    - Gait/balance\n39. PT/OT evaluation for fall prevention after surgery\n\nOsteoporosis:\n40. Patient on alendronate - good\n41. Continue osteoporosis management\n42. Ensure adequate calcium and Vitamin D\n43. Consider DEXA if not done recently\n44. Secondary fracture prevention is critical\n\nPostoperative Anticoagulation:\n45. Will need to restart anticoagulation for AFib\n46. Timing: Usually 24-48 hours postop per orthopedic surgeon\n47. Options:\n    - Resume warfarin with bridge if high stroke risk\n    - Consider DOAC (apixaban, rivaroxaban) easier to manage\n    - Balance bleeding vs stroke risk\n48. Discuss with cardiology if complex\n\nPostoperative Care (Anticipated):\n49. Early mobilization (day of surgery or POD 1)\n50. Weight-bearing as tolerated (cemented arthroplasty)\n51. DVT prophylaxis x 4 weeks (LMWH, DOAC, or aspirin per protocol)\n52. PT/OT for mobility, transfers, stairs\n53. Discharge planning: May need short-term rehab facility\n54. Home safety assessment before discharge home\n\nFamily Discussion:\n55. Hip fractures carry significant morbidity and mortality\n56. Surgery is necessary - non-operative management has very poor outcomes\n57. Goals of care discussion appropriate given age and surgical risk\n58. Advance directives confirmed\n\nFollow-up:\n59. Inpatient orthopedic care\n60. Postop follow-up with orthopedics in 2 weeks\n61. PCP follow-up within 1 week of discharge\n62. Anticoagulation management (PCP or cardiology)\n63.

Most partial rotator cuff tears respond to conservative treatment\n2. Trial of 3-6 months of conservative management before considering surgery\n\nActivity Modification:\n3. Avoid overhead lifting and aggravating activities\n4. Modify weightlifting routine:\n   - Stop overhead press temporarily\n   - Reduce or modify bench press (narrower grip, limited ROM)\n   - Focus on lower body and core\n5. Avoid sleeping on affected shoulder\n6. Use pillow to support arm at night\n\nPhysical Therapy (Key Treatment):\n7. PT referral for rotator cuff rehabilitation\n8. Protocol:\n   - Phase 1: Pain control, restore ROM, scapular stabilization\n   - Phase 2: Rotator cuff strengthening (isometric \u2192 isotonic)\n   - Phase 3: Progressive strengthening, sport-specific training\n9. Focus areas:\n   - Posterior capsule stretching (cross-body stretch, sleeper stretch)\n   - Rotator cuff strengthening (external rotation, scaption)\n   - Scapular stabilization (serratus anterior, lower trapezius)\n   - Posture correction (desk worker)\n10. Duration: 6-12 weeks minimum\n11. Compliance critical for success\n\nPharmacological Management:\n12. NSAIDs: Continue ibuprofen 600 mg TID with food PRN x 2-4 weeks\n13. Topical NSAIDs (diclofenac gel) as alternative\n14. Acetaminophen as adjunct\n15. Avoid long-term NSAID use (GI, renal, cardiovascular effects)\n\nCorticosteroid Injection (Consider):\n16. Subacromial corticosteroid injection may help:\n    - Reduces inflammation and bursitis\n    - Allows PT to progress\n    - Diagnostic (if pain relief, confirms impingement source)\n17. Options:\n    - Corticosteroid + lidocaine (e.g., 40 mg triamcinolone + 5 mL lidocaine)\n    - Ultrasound-guided preferred for accuracy\n18. Limit to 2-3 injections total (repeated injections may weaken tendon)\n19. Wait at least 3 months between injections\n\nPRP Injection (Emerging):\n20. Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injection:\n    - Some evidence for partial tears\n    - Not covered by most insurance\n    - Can discuss if patient interested and conservative measures fail\n21. Not first-line, but reasonable alternative to corticosteroid\n\nSurgical Indications:\n22. Surgery considered if:\n    - Failure of 3-6 months conservative treatment\n    - High-grade partial tear (>50%) not improving\n    - Progression to full-thickness tear\n    - Significant functional impairment\n23. Surgical options:\n    - Arthroscopic debridement (for low-grade partial tears)\n    - Arthroscopic repair (for high-grade partial tears, >50%)\n    - Subacromial decompression (if impingement component)\n24. This patient: 50% tear - may be candidate for repair if fails conservative treatment\n\nOrthopedic/Sports Medicine Referral:\n25. Refer if:\n    - Not improving with 6-8 weeks of PT\n    - Wants to discuss injection options\n    - Considering surgical evaluation\n26. For now: Trial conservative management\n\nReturn to Weightlifting:\n27. Gradual return after:\n    - Pain-free daily activities\n    - Full ROM restored\n    - Strength normalized with PT\n28. Start with light weights, avoid overhead initially\n29. Progress slowly, stop if pain returns\n30. May need to modify technique permanently (avoid certain exercises)\n\nPreventive Strategies:\n31. Proper warm-up before lifting\n32. Rotator cuff strengthening as part of routine (external rotation exercises)\n33. Balance pushing and pulling exercises\n34. Avoid excessive overhead volume\n35. Ensure proper form with all lifts\n\nFollow-up:\n36. Recheck in 6-8 weeks\n37. Earlier if worsening symptoms\n38. Repeat MRI only if considering surgery or concern for progression\n39. PT progress re-evaluation at 6 weeks"

For UNSTABLE fractures (not this patient):\n    - Indicators of instability:\n      - Medial clear space widening >4 mm (deltoid injury)\n      - Talar shift\n      - Syndesmosis widening\n      - Medial malleolus fracture (bimalleolar)\n    - Would require surgical fixation (ORIF)\n\nExpected Course (Non-Operative):\n20. Week 0-2: Splint, non-weight bearing, swelling control\n21. Week 2: Convert to boot or cast, may begin partial weight-bearing\n22. Week 4-6: Progressive weight-bearing in boot\n23. Week 6-8: Transition out of boot, begin PT\n24. Week 8-12: Return to normal activities gradually\n25. Full recovery: 3-4 months typically\n\nPhysical Therapy:\n26. PT referral when cleared by orthopedics (usually around 6 weeks)\n27. Focus on:\n    - ROM restoration\n    - Strengthening (especially peroneals)\n    - Proprioception and balance\n    - Gait training\n28. Reduces risk of chronic ankle instability\n\nComplications to Watch For:\n29. Return immediately or call if:\n    - Increasing pain despite elevation and medications\n    - Numbness or tingling in toes (nerve compression)\n    - Toes turning blue or cold (vascular compromise)\n    - Inability to wiggle toes\n    - Splint too tight (can loosen outer wrap)\n    - Fever, drainage (rare with closed fracture)\n30. Compartment syndrome: Rare in ankle, but monitor for severe pain, swelling\n\nSplint Care Instructions:\n31. Keep splint dry\n32. Do not put anything inside splint (no scratching)\n33. Elevate frequently\n34. Wiggle toes regularly to maintain circulation\n35. If outer wrap too tight, can loosen ACE bandage\n36. If severe concerns, return to ED\n\nWork/Activity:\n37. Will need time off work or modified duty (unable to stand)\n38. Provide work note as needed\n39. Driving: Not safe with left ankle injury (especially if manual transmission)\n40. No sports until cleared by orthopedics\n\nFollow-up:\n41. Orthopedics in 5-7 days\n42. Bring X-rays (or images available in system)\n43. Expect transition to definitive immobilization\n44. May need repeat imaging to confirm alignment"

Cervical myelopathy with cord compression is a SURGICAL condition\n2. Urgent referral to spine surgery (neurosurgery or orthopedic spine)\n3. Appointment within 1-2 weeks given progressive neurological deficits\n4. If rapid progression or bowel/bladder dysfunction develops \u2192 EMERGENT referral\n\nSurgical Indications (Met in This Patient):\n5. Moderate-severe myelopathy with functional impairment \u2713\n6. Progressive neurological deficits \u2713\n7. Cord compression on MRI with signal change \u2713\n8. Goals of surgery:\n   - Decompress spinal cord\n   - Halt progression\n   - Allow for neurological recovery (variable)\n\nSurgical Approaches:\n9. Anterior Approach:\n   - ACDF (Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion)\n   - Corpectomy with fusion\n   - Good for 1-2 level disease\n10. Posterior Approach:\n    - Laminectomy with or without fusion\n    - Laminoplasty\n    - Better for multilevel disease\n11. Combined anterior-posterior: For severe multilevel stenosis\n12. Surgeon will determine best approach based on imaging and patient factors\n\nConservative Management (Limited Role):\n13. Conservative treatment DOES NOT address cord compression\n14. Only for very mild myelopathy or poor surgical candidates\n15. If surgery declined or delayed:\n    - Cervical collar for support (soft collar) - controversial\n    - AVOID high-risk activities (falls, neck trauma)\n    - Close monitoring for progression\n16. This patient: SURGERY RECOMMENDED\n\nImmediate Precautions:\n17. Fall precautions - unsteady gait puts patient at high risk\n18. Avoid activities with fall risk (ladders - will affect work)\n19. Avoid neck extension and heavy lifting\n20. Home safety: Remove throw rugs, install grab bars\n21. Use assistive device (cane or walker) if unsteady\n22. Avoid contact sports, diving, rollercoasters (neck trauma)\n\nPain Management (Conservative):\n23. NSAIDs: Ibuprofen 600 mg TID with food if needed for pain\n24. Acetaminophen as alternative\n25. Gabapentin for neuropathic symptoms: Start 300 mg TID, titrate up\n26. Avoid opioids if possible (fall risk, post-op considerations)\n\nMedical Optimization for Surgery:\n27. A1c check (diabetic patient - optimize for surgery)\n28. Cardiac clearance if indicated (depends on cardiac history)\n29. Smoking cessation (patient is non-smoker \u2713)\n30. Hold certain medications pre-op per surgeon instructions\n\nWork Status:\n31. Cannot safely work as electrician (ladder work) with myelopathy\n32. Disability documentation if needed\n33. May return to modified/sedentary work post-recovery\n34. Discuss with surgeon regarding expected recovery timeline\n\nPrognostic Counseling:\n35. Surgery can halt progression in most cases\n36. Neurological recovery is variable:\n    - Cord signal change on MRI = some permanent damage likely\n    - Earlier surgery generally \u2192 better outcomes\n    - Gait often improves, hand function may improve less\n37. Some deficits may be permanent\n38. Without surgery, myelopathy typically progresses\n\nEmergency Symptoms:\n39. Go to ED immediately if:\n    - Sudden worsening of weakness (any limb)\n    - Bowel incontinence\n    - Bladder retention or incontinence\n    - Falls with potential neck injury\n    - Severe trauma (could cause complete cord injury)\n40. These could indicate acute cord compression - surgical emergency\n\nDiabetes Consideration:\n41. Optimize glycemic control before and after surgery\n42. A1c <8% ideal for surgical outcomes\n43. Continue metformin until surgical planning\n44. Diabetes may slow neurological recovery\n\nFollow-up:\n45. Spine surgery consultation in 1-2 weeks (urgent)\n46. PCP follow-up for diabetes, BP management\n47. PT consultation after surgery (post-op rehabilitation)\n48. Pre-operative testing as arranged by surgeon\n49. Close monitoring of neurological status - family aware of warning signs"

        "output": "### Subjective\nPatient is a 42-year-old female presenting with bilateral knee pain for 6 months, gradually worsening. Pain worse on right than left. Describes pain as aching, deep in the knees. Worse with stairs (especially going down), prolonged walking, rising from seated position. Morning stiffness lasting 15-20 minutes, improves with movement. Some swelling noted at end of day after prolonged activity. No locking. No giving way or instability. No trauma history. Has tried OTC ibuprofen with moderate relief. Unable to exercise due to pain - previously walked for exercise. Reports difficulty with daily activities (housework, shopping).\n\nRisk Factors:\n- Obesity (BMI 35)\n- Female gender\n- Family history: Mother had knee replacement\n- No prior knee injuries\n\nPast Medical History: Obesity, prediabetes, hypertension\nMedications: Lisinopril 10 mg daily, Metformin 500 mg BID\nAllergies: No known drug allergies\nSurgical History: C-section x 2\nSocial: Works as receptionist (mostly sedentary), lives with spouse and 2 children\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Blood Pressure: 134/86 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 78 bpm\n- BMI: 35 kg/m\u00b2 (Weight: 210 lbs, Height: 5'5\")\n\nPhysical Examination:\nGait:\n- Antalgic gait, slightly wide-based\n- Subtle varus thrust with walking (lateral knee thrust)\n\nBilateral Knees:\n- Inspection:\n  - Mild swelling bilaterally\n  - Varus alignment noted (bowlegged)\n  - No erythema, no skin changes\n- Palpation:\n  - Tenderness along medial joint lines bilaterally\n  - No lateral joint line tenderness\n  - Small effusion bilaterally\n  - No warmth\n- Range of Motion:\n  - Flexion: 125\u00b0 bilateral (mildly reduced from normal 135-140\u00b0)\n  - Extension: 0\u00b0 (full)\n  - Crepitus with ROM bilaterally (patellar and medial compartment)\n- Ligament Testing:\n  - Valgus/varus stress: Stable\n  - Lachman: Negative\n  - Anterior/Posterior drawer: Negative\n- Meniscal Testing:\n  - McMurray: Negative (no mechanical click)\n- Patellar:\n  - Patellar grind test: Mildly positive\n  - No significant patellofemoral crepitus\n\nImaging:\n- X-ray Bilateral Knees (AP, Lateral, Sunrise, Standing):\n  - Bilateral medial compartment joint space narrowing (right > left)\n  - Osteophyte formation medial femoral and tibial compartments\n  - Subchondral sclerosis medially\n  - Kellgren-Lawrence Grade: II-III bilateral\n  - Lateral compartment: Preserved\n  - Patellofemoral: Mild changes\n  - Mechanical axis: Varus alignment\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Primary Bilateral Knee Osteoarthritis, Medial Compartment (ICD-10: M17.0)\n\nKellgren-Lawrence Classification:\n- Grade 0: Normal\n- Grade I: Doubtful narrowing, possible osteophytes\n- Grade II: Definite osteophytes, possible narrowing\n- Grade III: Moderate osteophytes, definite narrowing, some sclerosis\n- Grade IV: Large osteophytes, marked narrowing, severe sclerosis\n- This patient: Grade II-III (moderate OA)\n\nContributing Factors:\n- Obesity (BMI 35) - major modifiable risk factor\n- Varus alignment - increased medial compartment loading\n- Female gender, family history\n\nAge Consideration:\n- 42 years old is relatively young for knee OA\n- Need to optimize conservative management\n- Delay arthroplasty as long as possible\n\n### Plan\nWeight Management (Most Important Intervention):\n1. Weight loss counseling - PRIMARY GOAL\n2. Even 10% weight loss can significantly reduce knee pain\n3. Every 1 lb lost = 4 lb reduction in knee loading\n4. Referral to dietitian/nutritionist\n5. Consider structured weight loss program\n6. Discuss medical weight management options:\n   - GLP-1 agonists (semaglutide, tirzepatide) - also helps prediabetes\n   - Discuss with PCP\n7. Goal: Lose 20-30 lbs (10-15% body weight) over 6-12 months\n\nExercise and Physical Therapy:\n8. Physical therapy referral\n9. PT goals:\n   - Quadriceps strengthening (most important for knee OA)\n   - Hamstring and hip strengthening\n   - ROM exercises\n   - Gait training\n10. Low-impact aerobic exercise:\n    - Swimming/water aerobics (best - unloads joints)\n    - Cycling (stationary bike)\n    - Elliptical machine\n    - Walking on flat surfaces\n11. Avoid: High-impact activities (running, jumping), deep squats, prolonged kneeling\n12. Home exercise program: Daily quadriceps sets, straight leg raises\n\nPharmacological Management:\n13. First-line: Topical NSAIDs\n    - Diclofenac gel (Voltaren) - apply to knees TID-QID\n    - Fewer systemic side effects than oral NSAIDs\n14. Oral NSAIDs (if topical insufficient):\n    - Meloxicam 15 mg daily, OR\n    - Naproxen 500 mg BID, OR\n    - Ibuprofen 600 mg TID\n    - Use with PPI if prolonged use (GI protection)\n    - Monitor renal function (already on lisinopril)\n15. Acetaminophen: 1000 mg TID as adjunct or alternative\n16. Avoid opioids for chronic OA management\n\nDuloxetine (Consider):\n17. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) 30-60 mg daily\n18. FDA-approved for chronic musculoskeletal pain including OA\n19. May help with pain centralization component\n20. Consider if not responding to above measures\n\nTopical Treatments:\n21. Capsaicin cream: Can try for localized pain\n22. TENS unit: Some patients find helpful\n\nBracing:\n23. Unloader brace for medial compartment OA:\n    - Shifts load from medial to lateral compartment\n    - Can reduce pain with activity\n    - Prescription for knee brace (medial unloader)\n24. May use soft knee sleeve for proprioception\n\nFootwear Modification:\n25. Lateral wedge insoles (controversial - may help varus knees)\n26. Cushioned, supportive shoes\n27. Avoid high heels\n28. Possible referral to podiatry for orthotics\n\nIntra-Articular Injections:\n29. Corticosteroid injection:\n    - Can provide 4-8 weeks of relief\n    - Limit to 3-4 injections per joint per year\n    - Repeated injections may accelerate cartilage loss\n    - Triamcinolone 40 mg per knee\n30. Hyaluronic acid (viscosupplementation):\n    - Gel-One, Synvisc, Euflexxa\n    - May provide longer-lasting relief (up to 6 months)\n    - Insurance coverage varies\n    - Best for mild-moderate OA\n31. Consider injection if oral medications insufficient\n\nSupplements (Limited Evidence):\n32. Glucosamine/Chondroitin: Mixed evidence, generally safe\n    - May try Glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg + Chondroitin 1200 mg daily\n    - 3-month trial, discontinue if no benefit\n33. Turmeric/Curcumin: Some anti-inflammatory evidence\n\nSurgical Options (Future Consideration):\n34. Too early for total knee replacement (age 42)\n35. Future options if failed conservative management:\n    - Arthroscopic debridement: Limited role in OA (not recommended routinely)\n    - Osteotomy:\n      - High tibial osteotomy (HTO) for young patients with varus alignment\n      - Realigns leg to shift load to healthy lateral compartment\n      - Delays need for replacement\n      - Consider referral if conservative measures fail\n    - Partial knee replacement (unicompartmental):\n      - For isolated medial compartment OA\n      - Good for younger, active patients\n    - Total knee arthroplasty:\n      - Last resort, typically for patients >60\n      - Lifespan of implant ~15-20 years\n      - Patient too young ideally\n36. Refer to orthopedics if:\n    - Failure of 3-6 months conservative treatment\n    - Functional impairment affecting quality of life\n    - To discuss osteotomy option\n\nLifestyle Modifications:\n37. Activity pacing - avoid prolonged standing/walking\n38. Use assistive devices if needed (cane in contralateral hand)\n39. Modify home/work: Avoid stairs when possible, ergonomic adjustments\n40. Continue working (sedentary job is compatible)\n\nComorbidity Management:\n41. Prediabetes + weight loss \u2192 May prevent diabetes progression\n42. Hypertension: Monitor with NSAID use (can raise BP, interact with ACE-I)\n43. If using NSAIDs, monitor BP and renal function\n\nFollow-up:\n44. Return in 6-8 weeks to assess response to treatment\n45. PT progress check\n46. Weight loss progress check\n47. Consider injections if inadequate response\n48. Orthopedic referral if failed conservative management\n49. Goals: Pain reduction, improved function, weight loss"

        "output": "### Subjective\nPatient is a 19-year-old male presenting to ED with left shoulder pain after football injury 1 hour ago. Was tackled while arm was in abduction and external rotation. Felt shoulder \"pop out.\" Immediate severe pain, unable to move arm since. Holding arm close to body. No numbness or tingling in arm. First episode - no prior shoulder dislocations. Dominant hand: Right.\n\nMechanism: Forced abduction + external rotation (classic mechanism for anterior dislocation)\n\nPast Medical History: None\nMedications: None\nAllergies: No known drug allergies\nSurgical History: None\nSocial: College student, plays college football (linebacker)\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Blood Pressure: 135/85 mmHg (elevated, pain)\n- Heart Rate: 95 bpm (tachycardic, pain)\n- Temperature: 98.6\u00b0F\n\nPhysical Examination:\nLeft Shoulder:\n- Inspection:\n  - Arm held in adduction and internal rotation (position of comfort)\n  - Loss of normal deltoid contour (squared-off appearance)\n  - Anterior fullness (humeral head palpable anteriorly)\n  - Posterior void visible (empty glenoid)\n  - No open wound\n- Palpation:\n  - Humeral head palpable anteriorly (in subcoracoid position)\n  - Acromion prominent\n  - Severe tenderness\n  - Muscle spasm\n- Range of Motion:\n  - Unable to move shoulder actively\n  - Does not allow passive motion (muscle guarding)\n- Sulcus Sign: Deferred (acute dislocation)\n\nNeurovascular Examination (Critical):\n- Axillary Nerve (Most commonly injured):\n  - Motor: Unable to test deltoid (pain) - will recheck post-reduction\n  - Sensory: Sensation INTACT over lateral deltoid (\"regimental badge\" area)\n- Musculocutaneous Nerve:\n  - Sensation intact lateral forearm\n- Radial Nerve: Intact (wrist extension, sensation dorsal hand)\n- Median Nerve: Intact (finger flexion, sensation)\n- Ulnar Nerve: Intact (finger abduction, sensation)\n- Pulses: Radial pulse 2+, capillary refill <2 seconds\n\nRight Shoulder: Normal, full ROM, stable\n\nImaging:\n- X-ray Left Shoulder (AP, Scapular Y, Axillary):\n  - Anterior shoulder dislocation confirmed\n  - Humeral head in subcoracoid position\n  - No associated fracture (no Hill-Sachs lesion visible, no Bankart bony defect on plain films)\n  - Greater tuberosity intact\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Anterior Glenohumeral (Shoulder) Dislocation, Left (ICD-10: S43.004A)\n\nType: Anterior (95% of shoulder dislocations are anterior)\n\nMechanism: Forced abduction, extension, and external rotation during tackle\n\nNeurovascular Status: INTACT pre-reduction\n\nAge Consideration:\n- Age 19 = HIGH risk of recurrence\n- Young athletic males have highest recurrence rate (up to 70-90% lifetime)\n- Contact sport athlete = even higher risk\n\n### Plan\nImmediate Management - Closed Reduction:\n1. Procedural sedation (preferred for muscle relaxation):\n   - Propofol sedation with monitoring, OR\n   - Ketamine sedation, OR\n   - Fentanyl + Midazolam\n2. Reduction technique options:\n   - External rotation method (gentle, low traction)\n   - Cunningham technique (patient seated, no sedation sometimes possible)\n   - Stimson technique (prone, dangling arm)\n   - Traction-countertraction (traditional)\n3. Reduction success felt as \"clunk\" of humeral head relocating\n4. If sedation not available or contraindicated: Intra-articular lidocaine injection (20 mL of 1% lidocaine) before reduction\n\nPost-Reduction:\n5. Neurovascular exam repeated IMMEDIATELY after reduction:\n   - Axillary nerve: Test deltoid strength, lateral deltoid sensation\n   - Pulses, sensation throughout\n6. Post-reduction X-rays: AP and axillary views to confirm concentric reduction\n7. ROM check: Should have improved, though will still be limited\n\nImmobilization:\n8. Sling immobilization\n9. Duration: Controversial, traditionally 3-6 weeks\n   - Recent evidence suggests shorter immobilization may be acceptable\n   - 1-3 weeks may be sufficient, early PT may not increase recurrence\n10. Position: Traditional (adduction, internal rotation) is standard\n    - External rotation bracing studied but not clearly superior\n11. Remove sling for gentle pendulum exercises after 1 week\n\nPain Management:\n12. Ice: 20 minutes every 2-3 hours for first 48-72 hours\n13. NSAIDs: Ibuprofen 600 mg TID with food x 7-10 days\n14. Acetaminophen 1000 mg q6h as adjunct\n15. Opioids: Short course if needed (Norco 5/325 q4-6h PRN x 3-5 days)\n16. Muscle relaxant: Cyclobenzaprine 10 mg TID PRN for spasm\n\nAdvanced Imaging:\n17. MRI left shoulder (after acute phase, usually 1-2 weeks):\n    - Evaluate for:\n      - Bankart lesion (anterior labral tear - common)\n      - Hill-Sachs lesion (posterior humeral head defect)\n      - Rotator cuff tear (uncommon in young patients)\n      - Other labral pathology\n18. MRI findings will guide surgical decision-making\n\nOrthopedic/Sports Medicine Follow-up:\n19. Follow-up with orthopedic surgery or sports medicine in 1-2 weeks\n20. Discuss imaging findings and surgical options\n21. Especially important given age (19) and sport (football)\n\nRecurrence Risk Counseling:\n22. YOUNG + ATHLETE + FIRST DISLOCATION = HIGH RECURRENCE RISK\n23. Recurrence rates:\n    - Age <20: Up to 70-90% lifetime recurrence with conservative treatment\n    - Age 20-30: 50-70%\n    - Age >40: 10-20%\n24. Each subsequent dislocation causes more bone loss and easier to redislocate\n25. This information important for surgical decision-making\n\nSurgical Consideration:\n26. Primary surgical repair (Bankart repair) increasingly recommended for:\n    - Young patients (<25 years)\n    - Contact sport athletes\n    - High-demand activities\n27. Evidence shows primary repair reduces recurrence rate significantly\n28. Discuss with orthopedics/sports medicine\n29. Surgical options:\n    - Arthroscopic Bankart repair (labral repair) - most common\n    - Open Bankart repair (if bone loss)\n    - Latarjet procedure (if significant bone loss)\n30. If MRI shows Bankart lesion + young athlete: Strong surgical recommendation\n\nConservative Management (If Chosen):\n31. Sling x 1-3 weeks\n32. Physical therapy starting at 1-2 weeks:\n    - Phase 1: Pendulum exercises, ROM\n    - Phase 2: Rotator cuff strengthening\n    - Phase 3: Sport-specific training\n33. Full recovery: 3-4 months\n34. Bracing for sport: Shoulder stabilizer brace\n35. Risk: High recurrence, especially with return to football\n\nReturn to Sport:\n36. Timeline depends on treatment approach:\n    - Conservative: 3-4 months (but high recurrence risk)\n    - Surgical repair: 4-6 months post-op\n37. Criteria: Full ROM, strength equal to opposite side, no apprehension, sport-specific testing\n38. Brace recommended for contact sports\n\nComplications to Monitor:\n39. Recurrent dislocation (most common, especially young athletes)\n40. Axillary nerve injury (usually neuropraxia, recovers in weeks-months)\n41. Rotator cuff tear (rare in young patients)\n42. Bone loss (cumulative with recurrent dislocations)\n43. Early arthritis (chronic instability)\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n44. Keep sling on except for exercises as instructed\n45. Ice regularly\n46. Take medications as prescribed\n47. No lifting, pushing, or reaching with left arm\n48. No sports until cleared\n49. Return immediately if:\n    - Numbness/tingling develops in arm\n    - Fingers turn blue or cold\n    - Shoulder feels like it \"pops out\" again\n    - Fever, severe swelling\n\nFollow-up:\n50. Orthopedics/Sports Medicine in 1-2 weeks\n51. Schedule MRI as recommended\n52. Athletic trainer/team physician involvement for return-to-play decisions"

Reassure patient: This is a common, self-limiting condition\n2. Prognosis: Most patients improve significantly within 2-4 weeks\n3. Early return to activity is BETTER than prolonged bed rest\n4. Bed rest >2-3 days is HARMFUL (deconditioning, prolongs recovery)\n5. Stay as active as possible within pain limits\n\nActivity:\n6. Avoid strict bed rest\n7. Continue walking and gentle activities\n8. Avoid heavy lifting, bending, twisting temporarily\n9. Resume normal activities as tolerated\n10. Gradual return to work with modifications\n\nPharmacological Management:\n11. First-line: NSAIDs\n    - Ibuprofen 600 mg TID with food, OR\n    - Naproxen 500 mg BID with food\n    - Continue for 7-10 days, then PRN\n    - Use shortest duration effective\n12. Acetaminophen: 1000 mg q6h PRN as adjunct\n13. Muscle relaxant (short-term):\n    - Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) 10 mg TID PRN for spasm\n    - OR Methocarbamol 750-1500 mg TID\n    - Limit to 1-2 weeks (sedating, habituation)\n    - Avoid with machinery operation\n14. AVOID opioids for acute mechanical LBP:\n    - Not superior to NSAIDs for this condition\n    - Risk of dependency\n    - Only if absolutely necessary and very short course\n\nNon-Pharmacological Treatments:\n15. Heat or ice:\n    - Heat: Heating pad, warm shower - may help muscle spasm\n    - Ice: If preferred, 20 min on/off\n    - Patient preference - both acceptable\n16. Gentle stretching:\n    - Knee-to-chest stretches\n    - Piriformis stretches\n    - Cat-cow exercises\n    - Avoid painful movements\n17. Walking: Best exercise for acute LBP\n\nPhysical Therapy:\n18. PT referral if:\n    - Not improving after 2-4 weeks\n    - Recurrent episodes\n    - Wants structured exercise program\n19. PT focus:\n    - Core strengthening\n    - McKenzie exercises\n    - Proper body mechanics\n    - Ergonomic training\n\nImaging:\n20. NOT INDICATED at this time (no red flags, <6 weeks)\n21. Consider imaging if:\n    - No improvement after 4-6 weeks\n    - Red flags develop\n    - Neurological symptoms appear\n22. Avoid early imaging - may find incidental abnormalities, lead to unnecessary intervention\n\nWork Status:\n23. May return to work with modifications:\n    - Avoid heavy lifting (>20 lbs)\n    - Avoid repetitive bending/twisting\n    - Frequent position changes\n    - Gradual return to full duty as symptoms allow\n24. Work note provided for modified duty x 1-2 weeks\n25. Worker's compensation documentation if applicable\n\nPrevention (After Recovery):\n26. Ergonomic lifting technique:\n    - Bend at knees, not waist\n    - Hold objects close to body\n    - Avoid twisting while lifting\n    - Get help for heavy loads\n27. Core strengthening exercises\n28. Maintain healthy weight (BMI 29 - weight loss beneficial)\n29. Smoking cessation (smoking impairs healing, increases disc degeneration)\n30. Regular exercise maintenance\n\nSmoking Cessation:\n31. Counsel on smoking cessation\n32. Smoking associated with:\n    - Chronic back pain\n    - Disc degeneration\n    - Poor healing\n33. Offer NRT, varenicline, or bupropion if interested\n34. Quitline: 1-800-QUIT-NOW\n\nReturn Precautions (Red Flags):\n35. Return immediately if:\n    - Leg weakness develops\n    - Numbness in legs or groin (saddle anesthesia)\n    - Loss of bowel or bladder control\n    - Pain radiating down leg below knee\n    - Fever\n    - Severe worsening pain\n36. These symptoms require urgent evaluation (possible nerve compression, cauda equina)\n\nWhen to Consider Further Workup:\n37. If no improvement at 4-6 weeks:\n    - Lumbar X-rays\n    - Consider MRI if radiculopathy symptoms\n38. If progressive symptoms: Earlier imaging\n39. Specialist referral: PM&R, spine specialist if refractory\n\nFollow-up:\n40. Return in 2-3 weeks if not improving\n41. Earlier if worsening or new symptoms\n42. No follow-up needed if resolving as expected\n43. PCP for ongoing management if chronic\n\nResources:\n44. Patient handout on back exercises\n45. Ergonomic lifting video/instructions\n46.

Mechanism: Non-contact pivot, felt \"pop,\" immediate swelling, couldn't continue playing.\n\nCurrent symptoms:\n- Knee swelling (improved from initial)\n- Feeling of instability, \"giving way\" sensation\n- Pain with pivoting\n- Unable to return to soccer\n- Walking okay on flat surfaces\n\nActivity level: Recreational athlete (soccer 1-2x/week, jogging, wants to return to sports)\n\nPrior knee issues: None\n\nMRI Report: Complete ACL tear, grade 1 MCL sprain, lateral meniscus contusion, no meniscal tear, no chondral injury\n\nPast Medical History: None\nMedications: Ibuprofen PRN\nAllergies: NKDA\nSocial: Non-smoker, accountant, active lifestyle\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 118/74, HR 68\n\nLeft Knee Exam:\n- Inspection: Mild effusion, no ecchymosis (2 weeks post-injury)\n- Palpation: Mild joint line tenderness medially (MCL)\n- ROM: 5-120\u00b0 (slight extension lag, flexion limited by pain)\n- Lachman Test: Positive - 2+ laxity with soft endpoint (pathognomonic for ACL)\n- Anterior Drawer: Positive\n- Pivot Shift: Positive (subluxation and reduction)\n- Valgus Stress at 30\u00b0: Grade 1 laxity (MCL sprain)\n- Valgus Stress at 0\u00b0: Stable\n- Varus Stress: Stable\n- McMurray: Negative\n- Joint Line Tenderness: Mild lateral (contusion)\n- Quadriceps: 4/5 (weakness from disuse)\n\nGait: Antalgic, guarded\n\nNeurovascular: Intact\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Complete Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Tear, Left Knee (ICD-10: S83.512A)\n\nAssociated:\n- Grade 1 MCL sprain (will heal conservatively)\n- Lateral meniscus contusion (no tear)\n\nClinical Correlation: Exam findings consistent with MRI - complete ACL rupture\n\nTreatment Decision Factors:\n- Age 42: Not too old for reconstruction\n- Activity level: Wants to return to pivoting sports (soccer)\n- Instability: Symptomatic (giving way)\n- Associated injuries: MCL healing, no meniscal repair needed\n\n### Plan\nSurgical vs Conservative Discussion:\n\n1. ACL reconstruction recommended given:\n   - Active patient wanting to return to pivoting sports\n   - Symptomatic instability (giving way)\n   - Without ACL, risk of further injury (meniscus tears, cartilage damage)\n   - Age 42 is appropriate for reconstruction\n\n2. Conservative (non-operative) considerations:\n   - Option if patient willing to give up pivoting/cutting sports\n   - Focus on strengthening, bracing\n   - Higher risk of secondary injuries without reconstruction\n   - Not recommended for this active patient\n\n3. Patient preference: Wants surgery to return to soccer\n\nPre-Operative Optimization:\n\n4. \"Prehab\" - pre-operative physical therapy:\n   - Restore full ROM (especially extension)\n   - Reduce swelling\n   - Strengthen quadriceps\n   - Surgery after swelling resolved and ROM near-normal (usually 2-4 weeks)\n\n5. Goal before surgery:\n   - Full extension (0\u00b0)\n   - Flexion >120\u00b0\n   - Minimal effusion\n   - Quadriceps activation\n\n6. PT referral for prehab starting now\n\nMCL Sprain:\n\n7. Grade 1 MCL will heal conservatively\n8. Hinged knee brace for comfort/protection\n9. MCL should be healed before ACL surgery\n10. Timeline: 2-4 weeks for Grade 1 MCL\n\nSurgical Planning:\n\n11. ACL reconstruction surgery scheduled in 3-4 weeks (after prehab and MCL healing)\n\n12. Graft options discussed:\n    - Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) autograft: Gold standard for high-level athletes, strong fixation, risk of anterior knee pain\n    - Hamstring autograft: Less anterior knee pain, slightly higher re-tear rate\n    - Quadriceps tendon autograft: Good strength, newer option\n    - Allograft: Faster recovery, but higher re-tear rate in young/active patients (not recommended for this patient)\n\n13. Recommendation: BTB autograft or quadriceps tendon autograft\n14. Patient to decide after reviewing graft options\n\n15. Anesthesia: Spinal vs general (anesthesia will discuss)\n16. Outpatient surgery (home same day typically)\n\nPost-Operative Expectations:\n\n17. Timeline:\n    - Weeks 0-2: Rest, ice, crutches, ROM exercises\n    - Weeks 2-6: Progressive ROM, begin strengthening\n    - Months 2-4: Progressive strengthening, stationary bike, pool\n    - Months 4-6: Running, agility drills\n    - Months 6-9+: Sport-specific training, return to sport\n\n18. Full recovery: 9-12 months typically\n\n19. Physical therapy: 2-3x/week for 4-6 months post-op\n\n20. Brace: Post-op brace x 4-6 weeks\n\n21. Crutches: 2-4 weeks\n\n22. Driving: 4-6 weeks (left knee; would be longer if right)\n\n23. Work: Desk work 1-2 weeks, physical work 3-6 months\n\nRisks Discussed:\n\n24. Surgical risks:\n    - Re-tear (5-15%)\n    - Graft site pain\n    - Stiffness\n    - Infection (<1%)\n    - Blood clots\n    - Nerve injury (rare)\n    - Incomplete return to sport level\n\n25. Signed consent obtained\n\nCurrent Management:\n\n26. Hinged knee brace for stability\n27. Crutches as needed for comfort\n28. Ice 15-20 min, 3-4x daily\n29. Ibuprofen 600 mg TID with food for 1 week\n30. Elevate leg when sitting\n31. Begin prehab PT this week\n\nPre-Op Workup:\n\n32. Pre-operative labs (CBC, BMP, PT/INR)\n33. EKG (if indicated by anesthesia)\n34. Pre-op visit with surgery scheduler\n35. NPO after midnight before surgery\n36. Stop NSAIDs 1 week before surgery\n37. No aspirin 1 week before\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n38. Pre-op visit in 2-3 weeks:\n    - Check ROM, swelling\n    - Confirm surgical date\n    - Answer questions\n\n39. Surgery in ~3-4 weeks\n\nPatient Education:\n\n40. ACL reconstruction has excellent outcomes\n41. Prehab is important - don't skip PT before surgery\n42. Post-op compliance is critical for success\n43. Return to soccer expected but will take 9-12 months\n44. Re-injury prevention: Neuromuscular training important"

Re-examine median nerve sensation after reduction\n   - Expect improvement with reduction (relieving pressure)\n   - If no improvement or worsening: URGENT ORTHOPEDIC CONSULT for possible carpal tunnel release\n\n9. Radial pulse, capillary refill, finger motion: Confirm intact\n\nSplint Care:\n\n10. Sugar-tong splint instructions:\n    - Keep elevated above heart level\n    - Ice 15-20 min every 2 hours\n    - Move fingers frequently (prevent stiffness)\n    - Do not get wet\n    - Loosen if too tight (swelling)\n\n11. Return immediately if:\n    - Increasing numbness or tingling\n    - Fingers turning blue or white\n    - Severe increasing pain despite elevation/ice\n    - Cannot move fingers\n\nPain Management:\n\n12. Ibuprofen 600 mg q6h with food x 5-7 days (unless contraindicated)\n13. Acetaminophen 1000 mg q6h alternating\n14. Oxycodone 5 mg q4-6h PRN for breakthrough (#10) - use sparingly\n15. Elevate and ice aggressively\n\nSurgical Consultation:\n\n16. Orthopedics consult indicated for:\n    - Young patient with high functional demands\n    - May need ORIF (open reduction internal fixation) vs volar locking plate\n    - If reduction unstable or re-displaces\n    - Intra-articular involvement (if present)\n    - Persistent median nerve symptoms\n\n17. Consult placed - orthopedics to evaluate\n\nOrtho Will Decide:\n\n18. Treatment options:\n    a) Cast immobilization (if reduction stable, acceptable alignment)\n    b) ORIF with volar locking plate (preferred for young active patient with displaced fracture)\n    c) External fixation (rare, for highly comminuted)\n\n19. Likely recommendation: ORIF given:\n    - Young, active patient\n    - Dominant hand\n    - Significantly displaced fracture\n    - Better outcomes with surgical fixation in this population\n\nDisposition:\n\n20. If orthopedics available today: Consult for surgical planning\n21. If surgery needed: Schedule within 1-2 weeks\n22. May discharge with splint and close ortho follow-up if:\n    - Good reduction\n    - Stable\n    - Neuro improving\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n23. Ortho follow-up in 2-3 days for:\n    - Re-evaluation\n    - Repeat X-rays (check for displacement)\n    - Surgical planning\n\n24. If conservative: Cast at 1-2 weeks when swelling down, then for 4-6 weeks total\n\n25. Physical/occupational therapy after immobilization period\n\nTetanus:\n\n26.

Recommend surgical decompression given:\n   - Severe stenosis with neurogenic claudication\n   - Failed comprehensive conservative management\n   - Significant quality of life impairment\n   - Neurological findings (weakness)\n\n2. Procedure: Laminectomy L4-5 (\u00b1 L3-4) with possible fusion\n\n3. Decompression alone vs with fusion:\n   - Decompression alone: If stable spine, no significant spondylolisthesis progression\n   - Fusion consideration: Grade 1 spondylolisthesis present\n   - Decision: May need fusion given spondylolisthesis (discuss with spine surgeon)\n\n4. Surgical options:\n   a) Laminectomy (open decompression)\n   b) Minimally invasive decompression\n   c) Laminectomy with fusion (if instability)\n   d) Interspinous spacer (less invasive, for selected patients)\n\n5. Referral to spine surgery for procedure\n\nPre-Operative Optimization:\n\n6. Medical clearance:\n   - Age 70 with HTN - cardiology clearance if indicated\n   - EKG: Obtained, normal\n   - No active cardiac symptoms, functional capacity limited by stenosis\n\n7. Labs:\n   - CBC, CMP, PT/INR\n   - Type and screen\n   - HbA1c (if diabetic)\n   - Urinalysis\n\n8. Smoking: Non-smoker (excellent - smoking impairs fusion)\n\n9. BMI 28: Acceptable, weight optimization if possible\n\n10. BPH/Tamsulosin: Continue - may have urinary retention post-op regardless\n\n11. Medications:\n    - Amlodipine: Continue\n    - Gabapentin: Continue through surgery\n    - Review anticoagulants/antiplatelets: None currently\n\nAnesthesia:\n\n12. General anesthesia for spine surgery\n13. Position: Prone\n14. Pre-op anesthesia evaluation\n\nSurgical Details:\n\n15. Hospital stay: 1-3 days typically\n16. Recovery: 6-12 weeks for full recovery\n17. Immediate post-op: May have improvement in leg symptoms\n18. Physical therapy: Start post-op\n\nRisks Discussed:\n\n19. General:\n    - Infection (1-3%)\n    - Bleeding/hematoma\n    - DVT/PE\n    - Anesthesia risks\n\n20. Spine-specific:\n    - Dural tear/CSF leak (5-10%)\n    - Nerve injury (numbness, weakness)\n    - Recurrent stenosis (restenosis)\n    - Incomplete relief of symptoms\n    - Need for additional surgery\n    - If fusion: Hardware complications, non-union\n\n21. Realistic expectations:\n    - Leg symptoms (claudication, numbness): 70-80% improvement\n    - Back pain: Less predictable improvement\n    - May not return to full prior function\n\n22. Consent obtained\n\nPost-Operative Plan:\n\n23. Activity:\n    - Walking encouraged immediately\n    - No bending, lifting, twisting (BLT restrictions) for 6 weeks\n    - Progressive activity increase\n\n24. Bracing: TLSO brace if fusion (8-12 weeks)\n\n25. DVT prophylaxis: SCDs, early ambulation, consider pharmacologic\n\n26. Pain management: Multimodal, minimize opioids\n\n27. Physical therapy: Start inpatient, continue outpatient\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n28. Pre-op visit: 1-2 weeks before surgery (markings, final consent)\n29. Surgery: Scheduled in 4 weeks\n30. Post-op visits: 2 weeks (wound), 6 weeks (X-ray), 3 months, 6 months, 1 year\n\nContinue Conservative Measures While Awaiting Surgery:\n\n31. Continue gabapentin\n32. Activity as tolerated\n33. Use cane for safety\n34. Call if worsening weakness, bowel/bladder changes (cauda equina emergency)\n\nPatient Education:\n\n35. Surgery is elective but recommended given severity and failed conservative care\n36. Goal: Improve walking ability and leg symptoms\n37. Realistic expectations discussed\n38. Recovery takes months, compliance with restrictions is important\n39. Most patients are satisfied with surgical outcomes for stenosis"

Pre-op visit: 1 week before surgery\n9. NPO after midnight before surgery\n\nMedications:\n\n10. Stop NSAIDs 1 week before surgery (bleeding risk)\n11. No aspirin 1 week before (unless cardiology requires - not applicable)\n12. Continue lisinopril with sip of water morning of surgery\n13. No herbal supplements 2 weeks before\n\nSurgical Details:\n\n14. Procedure: Right knee arthroscopy with meniscal surgery\n15. Outpatient surgery (same-day discharge)\n16. Duration: 30-60 minutes typically\n17. Anesthesia: As above\n\nPost-Operative Plan:\n\nIf Partial Meniscectomy:\n\n18. Weight-bearing: Full weight-bearing immediately\n19. Crutches: 1-3 days for comfort\n20. Brace: May not be needed or hinged knee brace for comfort\n21. ROM: Immediate (no restrictions)\n22. PT: Start within 1 week, 2-3 sessions/week x 4-6 weeks\n23. Return to desk work: 1-2 days\n24. Return to sport: 4-6 weeks\n\nIf Meniscal Repair:\n\n25. Weight-bearing: Partial or protected weight-bearing x 6 weeks (varies by surgeon)\n26.

EMG/Nerve Conduction Study ordered:\n   - Confirm diagnosis and localization to elbow\n   - Assess severity\n   - Rule out other neuropathies\n\n2. Expected findings:\n   - Slowing of ulnar nerve conduction velocity across elbow (>10 m/s drop)\n   - Reduced amplitude if severe\n   - EMG: May show denervation in ulnar-innervated muscles if advanced\n\n3. Results guide treatment:\n   - Mild: Conservative management\n   - Moderate-severe: Consider surgery\n   - Denervation present: Often surgical indication\n\nConservative Management (First-Line for Mild-Moderate):\n\n4. Activity modification:\n   - Avoid prolonged elbow flexion\n   - Avoid leaning on elbow\n   - Ergonomic modifications at workstation\n   - Avoid resting elbow on desk\n   - Phone: Use speaker or headset (don't hold to ear)\n\n5. Night splinting:\n   - Elbow extension splint or pad\n   - Keeps elbow in ~30-45\u00b0 flexion (neutral, not fully extended)\n   - Prevents extreme flexion during sleep\n   - Commercial cubital tunnel brace or wrapped towel around elbow\n\n6. Elbow pad:\n   - Wear during day to prevent direct pressure on nerve\n   - Protects when leaning on surfaces\n\n7. Nerve gliding exercises:\n   - Ulnar nerve glides\n   - Physical/occupational therapy referral\n   - Taught technique today\n\n8. NSAIDs:\n   - Ibuprofen 400 mg TID PRN for pain\n   - Limited efficacy for neuropathy but may help inflammation\n\n9. Avoid activities that worsen symptoms for 4-6 weeks\n\nWorkplace Modifications:\n\n10. Ergonomic assessment\n11. Raise monitor/adjust chair (reduce elbow flexion)\n12. Elbow pad at desk edge\n13. Frequent breaks from mouse/keyboard\n14. Consider ergonomic mouse (less elbow position stress)\n\nSurgical Consideration:\n\n15. Refer to hand surgery if:\n    - Conservative treatment fails (3-6 months)\n    - Progressive weakness\n    - Muscle atrophy develops\n    - Severe EMG findings (significant denervation)\n    - Patient preference for definitive treatment\n\n16. Surgical options:\n    a) In situ decompression (simple release)\n    b) Medial epicondylectomy\n    c) Anterior transposition (subcutaneous, intramuscular, or submuscular)\n\n17. Surgery success rate: 80-90% symptom improvement\n\nPrognosis:\n\n18. Mild-moderate cases: Often improve with conservative measures\n19. If weakness/atrophy present: Surgery usually recommended before permanent damage\n20. Early intervention = better outcomes\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n21. Return in 4-6 weeks:\n    - Review EMG results\n    - Assess conservative treatment response\n    - Discuss surgical option if not improving\n\n22. Sooner if:\n    - Worsening weakness\n    - Progressive numbness\n    - Developing muscle wasting\n\nPatient Education:\n\n23. Cubital tunnel is like carpal tunnel but at the elbow\n24. Ulnar nerve is \"funny bone\" nerve\n25. Avoiding elbow flexion is key\n26. Night splinting often very helpful\n27. Early treatment prevents permanent nerve damage\n28.

Consider admission vs outpatient based on:\n   - O2 sat 94% - borderline (\u226492% usually requires admission)\n   - Mild respiratory distress - manageable\n   - Oral intake - reduced but still taking some fluids\n   - Parents reliable, can monitor at home\n2. Decision: Outpatient treatment appropriate if:\n   - Tolerates oral antibiotics\n   - O2 sat improves with fever control\n   - Parents can provide close monitoring\n3. Criteria for admission:\n   - O2 sat \u226492% persistently\n   - Severe respiratory distress\n   - Unable to tolerate oral antibiotics/fluids\n   - Toxic appearance\n   - Age <6 months\n   - Failure of outpatient treatment\n\nAntibiotic Therapy:\n4. First-line outpatient: High-dose Amoxicillin\n   - Amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/day divided BID or TID x 5-7 days\n   - For this patient (14 kg): ~630 mg BID or ~420 mg TID\n   - Covers S. pneumoniae including intermediate resistance\n5. Alternative if penicillin allergy (non-severe):\n   - Cefdinir, Cefuroxime, Cefpodoxime\n6. Alternative if severe penicillin allergy:\n   - Azithromycin (but less effective against S. pneumoniae)\n7. If atypical suspected (older child, walkng pneumonia presentation):\n   - Add or use Azithromycin 10 mg/kg day 1, then 5 mg/kg days 2-5\n\nSupportive Care:\n8. Antipyretics:\n   - Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg q4-6h PRN fever (max 75 mg/kg/day)\n   - Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg q6-8h PRN fever (if >6 months, which this child is)\n   - Can alternate\n9. Hydration: Encourage fluids - small frequent amounts\n10. Rest: Age-appropriate activity as tolerated\n11. Humidifier: May help with comfort\n12. No cough suppressants in young children (not recommended <6 years)\n13. Honey for cough if >1 year old (safe for 3-year-old): 2.5-5 mL at bedtime\n\nOxygen Monitoring:\n14. If treating as outpatient with O2 sat 94%:\n    - Recheck O2 sat after fever control (often improves)\n    - If <92% - admit\n    - Return precautions for worsening respiratory distress\n15. Pulse oximeter at home if available (optional)\n\nFollow-up:\n16. Recheck in 24-48 hours if not improving\n17. Should see improvement in fever within 48-72 hours of antibiotics\n18. Complete antibiotic course even if feeling better\n19. Return immediately if: Increased work of breathing, lethargy, unable to drink, high fever not responding to antipyretics, blue lips\n\nIf Admitted:\n20. IV antibiotics: Ampicillin 150-200 mg/kg/day divided q6h\n21. Or Ceftriaxone 50-75 mg/kg/day IV if severe\n22. Oxygen to maintain O2 sat \u226592%\n23. IV fluids if poor oral intake\n24. Transition to oral when: Afebrile 24-48 hours, tolerating PO, O2 sat stable\n\nViral Panel:\n25. If RSV or influenza positive:\n    - May explain etiology (viral pneumonia)\n    - Oseltamivir if influenza and within 48 hours of symptoms\n26. Bacterial superinfection can occur with viral pneumonia\n\nVaccine Review:\n27. PCV13 up to date - reduces invasive pneumococcal disease\n28. Annual influenza vaccine - ensure current season\n29. COVID-19 vaccine - per current recommendations\n\nParent Education:\n30. Signs of worsening: Fast breathing, retractions, nasal flaring, grunting, lethargy, poor color, refusing to drink\n31. Fever may persist 2-3 days even with treatment\n32. Full recovery expected with appropriate treatment\n33. Cough may persist 2-3 weeks after infection clears\n\nFollow-up:\n34.

First-line: High-dose Amoxicillin\n   - Amoxicillin 80-90 mg/kg/day divided BID x 10 days\n   - For this patient (8.5 kg): ~380 mg BID\n   - Suspension: 400 mg/5mL - give 4.7 mL (round to 5 mL) BID\n2. Duration: 10 days (age <2 years)\n   - Children \u22652 years with mild symptoms: 5-7 days acceptable\n3. Why treat (vs observation):\n   - Age <2 years\n   - Moderate-severe symptoms (fever 103, bulging TM)\n   - Not a candidate for observation\n\nIf Amoxicillin Allergy:\n4. Non-severe allergy (rash only):\n   - Cefdinir 14 mg/kg/day divided BID, OR\n   - Cefuroxime 30 mg/kg/day divided BID, OR\n   - Cefpodoxime 10 mg/kg/day divided BID\n5. Severe allergy (anaphylaxis, angioedema):\n   - Azithromycin 10 mg/kg day 1, then 5 mg/kg days 2-5\n   - Less effective but avoids beta-lactams\n\nIf Treatment Failure (No Improvement in 48-72 Hours):\n6. Switch to Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 90 mg/kg/day (amoxicillin component) divided BID\n7. Covers beta-lactamase producing organisms (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis)\n8. Re-evaluate to confirm diagnosis\n\nPain Management (Important):\n9. Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg q4-6h PRN pain/fever\n   - For 8.5 kg: ~125 mg q4-6h (or use infant drops/suspension per concentration)\n10. Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg q6-8h PRN (safe at 8 months)\n    - For 8.5 kg: ~85 mg q6-8h\n11. Pain relief is important - AOM is very painful\n12. Can alternate acetaminophen and ibuprofen\n13. Avoid ear drops with perforated TM (none currently)\n\nSupportive Care:\n14. Encourage oral fluids (formula, water, Pedialyte)\n15. Small frequent feeds if decreased appetite\n16. Elevate head of crib slightly for comfort\n17. Warm compress to ear for comfort (optional)\n\nAnticipatory Guidance:\n18. Fever should improve within 48-72 hours of antibiotics\n19. Pain should improve within 24-48 hours\n20. Complete full course of antibiotics even if symptoms improve\n21. Effusion may persist for weeks-months after infection clears (normal)\n22. Hearing may be temporarily decreased (usually resolves)\n\nReturn Precautions:\n23. Return or call if:\n    - Fever persists >48-72 hours on antibiotics\n    - Worsening symptoms\n    - New symptoms: Rash (drug reaction), vomiting (can't take antibiotics)\n    - Redness/swelling behind ear (mastoiditis - emergency)\n    - Lethargy, inconsolable crying\n24. If vomiting and can't keep down oral antibiotics: May need IM ceftriaxone\n\nFollow-up:\n25. Routine follow-up NOT required if clinical improvement\n26. Follow-up in 48-72 hours if symptoms not improving\n27. If recurrent AOM (\u22653 episodes in 6 months or \u22654 in 12 months):\n    - ENT referral for tympanostomy tubes consideration\n28. Hearing evaluation if persistent effusion >3 months\n\nPrevention Counseling:\n29. Avoid secondhand smoke exposure (risk factor for AOM)\n30. Daycare exposure increases risk (unavoidable for many families)\n31. Breastfeeding is protective (patient is formula-fed)\n32. Avoid bottle-propping (feeding flat increases reflux into Eustachian tube)\n33. PCV13 vaccine reduces invasive pneumococcal disease and AOM\n34. Annual influenza vaccine (influenza increases AOM risk)\n\nCommon Concerns:\n35. Flying with AOM: May increase pain during altitude changes\n36. Swimming: Generally avoid until acute infection resolves\n37. Antibiotic side effects: Diarrhea, rash (contact if concerning)\n\nReferral:\n38. ENT referral if:\n    - Recurrent AOM (\u22653/6 months or \u22654/12 months)\n    - Chronic otitis media with effusion (>3 months)\n    - Hearing concerns\n    - Complications (mastoiditis, facial nerve palsy)"

Daycare had outbreak of \"stomach bug\" - 5 other children affected.\n\nNo recent travel, no new foods introduced, no antibiotic use.\n\nPast Medical History: Healthy infant\nMedications: None\nAllergies: No known drug allergies\nImmunizations: Up to date including rotavirus vaccine\nBirth History: Term, uncomplicated\nFeeding: Formula-fed, solids introduced at 6 months\nDevelopment: Normal\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Temperature: 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C)\n- Heart Rate: 150 bpm (tachycardic - concerning for dehydration)\n- Respiratory Rate: 28 breaths/min (normal)\n- Blood Pressure: 85/55 mmHg (low-normal for age)\n- Weight: 8.0 kg (was 8.5 kg at 9-month well visit - 6% weight loss)\n- O2 Saturation: 99% on room air\n\nGeneral Appearance:\n- Mildly lethargic but arousable\n- Irritable when examined, crying weakly\n- Not vigorous\n\nPhysical Examination (Dehydration Assessment):\n- HEENT:\n  - Anterior fontanelle: Sunken (moderate dehydration sign)\n  - Eyes: Sunken (moderate dehydration sign)\n  - Tears: Decreased - crying with few tears\n  - Mucous membranes: Dry, tacky\n- Skin:\n  - Turgor: Slightly decreased (tents ~2 seconds)\n  - Capillary refill: 2-3 seconds (slightly prolonged)\n- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, regular, weak peripheral pulses\n- Abdomen:\n  - Soft, hyperactive bowel sounds\n  - Non-tender, non-distended\n  - No masses\n- Neurological: Arousable but less active than normal, irritable\n- Extremities: Cool peripheries\n\nDehydration Severity Assessment:\n- Moderate dehydration (5-10% body weight loss):\n  - Weight loss ~6% \u2713\n  - Sunken fontanelle \u2713\n  - Sunken eyes \u2713\n  - Decreased tears \u2713\n  - Dry mucous membranes \u2713\n  - Tachycardia \u2713\n  - Decreased skin turgor \u2713\n  - Decreased urine output \u2713\n\nLaboratory (if obtained):\n- Point-of-care glucose: 75 mg/dL (normal)\n- BMP (if obtained):\n  - Na: 140 mEq/L\n  - K: 3.8 mEq/L\n  - Cl: 105 mEq/L\n  - Bicarb: 18 mEq/L (mildly low - mild metabolic acidosis from dehydration)\n  - BUN: 22 mg/dL (elevated - dehydration)\n  - Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL (normal)\n- Stool studies: Not routinely needed for viral gastroenteritis (consider if bloody diarrhea, prolonged course)\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Acute Viral Gastroenteritis with Moderate Dehydration (ICD-10: A08.4, E86.0)\n\nDehydration Severity: Moderate (5-10% body weight loss)\n\nLikely Etiology: Viral (rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus)\n- Daycare outbreak supports viral etiology\n- Rotavirus vaccine reduces severity but doesn't prevent all disease\n- Norovirus is common cause of outbreaks in childcare settings\n\n### Plan\nRehydration - Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT):\n1. First-line: Oral rehydration solution (ORS)\n   - Pedialyte, Enfalyte, or generic ORS\n   - WHO-ORS formulation preferred\n2. For moderate dehydration:\n   - Replacement: 50-100 mL/kg over 4 hours\n   - For this patient (8 kg): 400-800 mL over 4 hours\n   - Give small, frequent amounts (5-10 mL every 1-2 minutes via syringe/spoon)\n3. If vomiting:\n   - Wait 10-15 minutes after vomiting episode\n   - Give small amounts (5 mL) every 1-2 minutes\n   - Slow administration is key to tolerance\n4. Avoid: Juice, soda, sports drinks (too much sugar, osmotic diarrhea)\n\nAntiemetic (If Vomiting Prevents ORT):\n5. Ondansetron (Zofran) ODT:\n   - Weight-based dosing:\n     - 8-15 kg: 2 mg x 1 dose\n     - This patient (8 kg): 2 mg ODT x 1\n   - Dissolves on tongue, reduces vomiting\n   - Allows oral rehydration to succeed\n   - Single dose usually sufficient\n6. Wait 15-30 minutes after ondansetron, then start ORS\n\nContinue Feeding:\n7. Do NOT withhold feeds once rehydration started\n8. Resume formula as soon as tolerating ORS (within 4 hours)\n9. Breast milk if breastfeeding (never stop)\n10. Age-appropriate solids as tolerated:\n    - Bland diet: Bananas, rice cereal, applesauce, toast (BRAT)\n    - Avoid fatty, sugary foods\n11. Lactose-free formula NOT routinely needed (may use if prolonged diarrhea >7 days)\n\nIV Rehydration (If ORT Fails or Severe):\n12. Indications for IV:\n    - Unable to tolerate ORS despite antiemetic\n    - Severe dehydration (>10% weight loss)\n    - Altered mental status, lethargy\n    - Shock\n13. IV fluid:\n    - Bolus: Normal saline 20 mL/kg over 20-30 minutes (reassess after)\n    - Maintenance: D5 1/2 NS or D5 NS based on electrolytes\n14. This patient: Trial ORT first, IV if fails\n\nMonitoring During Rehydration:\n15. Reassess hydration status every 1-2 hours:\n    - Heart rate trending down\n    - Improved mental status\n    - Tears present when crying\n    - Mucous membranes moist\n    - Urine output resuming\n16. Goal: Urine output within 4 hours of starting ORT\n17. Weight check after rehydration (should approach baseline)\n\nNo Antibiotics:\n18. Viral gastroenteritis - antibiotics NOT indicated\n19. Antibiotics only for: Bloody diarrhea suggesting bacterial cause, severe dehydration with suspected bacterial sepsis, specific pathogens (Shigella, Cholera, C. diff)\n\nNo Antidiarrheals:\n20. Loperamide (Imodium) CONTRAINDICATED in infants/young children\n21. Can cause ileus, toxic megacolon\n22. Let diarrhea run its course\n\nProbiotics:\n23. May consider probiotics (Lactobacillus) - modest benefit\n24. Reduces diarrhea duration by ~1 day\n25. Safe but not essential\n\nInfection Control:\n26. Good hand hygiene (soap and water, alcohol gel less effective for norovirus)\n27. May return to daycare when diarrhea-free for 24 hours\n28. Clean surfaces with bleach solution\n29. Siblings at risk - watch for symptoms\n\nDischarge Criteria (if seen in ED/clinic):\n30. Can discharge if:\n    - Tolerating ORS\n    - No vomiting after ondansetron\n    - Improved hydration status\n    - Parent can continue ORT at home\n    - Follow-up available\n31. Send home with Pedialyte, instructions for ORT\n\nReturn Precautions:\n32. Return immediately if:\n    - Unable to keep fluids down\n    - No wet diaper in 8 hours\n    - Blood in stool or vomit\n    - Lethargy, difficult to arouse\n    - Sunken fontanelle worsening\n    - High fever (>104\u00b0F)\n    - Abdominal distension or severe pain\n    - Symptoms not improving in 24-48 hours\n\nFollow-up:\n33. Call or return in 24 hours for recheck\n34. PCP follow-up in 2-3 days if not improving\n35. Diarrhea may persist 5-7 days (normal viral course)\n36. Full recovery expected\n\nPrevention:\n37. Rotavirus vaccine - already received\n38. Hand hygiene education for family\n39. Daycare infection control measures"

Parents report the child had high fever (up to 104\u00b0F) for 3 days prior to rash. Fever resolved about 12 hours before rash appeared. Rash started on trunk and spread to face, neck, and extremities over past 24 hours. No itching reported. Child is acting normally now - eating, drinking, playing. No cough, no runny nose. No vomiting, no diarrhea. No joint pain.\n\nDuring fever: Child was fussy, decreased appetite, slightly less active. No seizure activity. Parents gave acetaminophen and ibuprofen for fever control.\n\nNo sick contacts known. Attends preschool - no known outbreaks. No recent travel. No new exposures (medications, foods, detergents).\n\nPast Medical History: Healthy child, no chronic conditions\nMedications: None (acetaminophen/ibuprofen during febrile illness)\nAllergies: No known drug allergies\nImmunizations: Up to date (MMR received at 12 months and 4 years)\nDevelopment: Normal\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Temperature: 98.6\u00b0F (afebrile now)\n- Heart Rate: 95 bpm (normal)\n- Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths/min (normal)\n- Blood Pressure: 95/60 mmHg\n- Weight: 16 kg\n\nGeneral Appearance:\n- Well-appearing, active, playful\n- Not toxic, not ill-appearing\n- In no distress\n\nPhysical Examination:\n- HEENT:\n  - Oropharynx: Normal, no enanthem, no Koplik spots\n  - No conjunctivitis\n  - TMs: Normal bilaterally\n  - Mild posterior cervical and occipital lymphadenopathy (small, non-tender, mobile)\n- Skin:\n  - Rash characteristics:\n    - Erythematous maculopapular eruption\n    - Discrete macules and papules, 2-5 mm\n    - Blanches with pressure (blanching)\n    - Distribution: Trunk (most prominent), face, neck, proximal extremities\n    - Spares palms and soles\n    - Not petechial, not purpuric\n    - Non-pruritic per parents\n    - No vesicles, no pustules, no bullae\n  - No desquamation\n- Neck: Supple, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy (small, bilateral)\n- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation\n- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur\n- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly\n- Extremities: No joint swelling, no edema\n- Neurological: Normal for age, alert, interactive\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Viral Exanthem - Roseola Infantum (Exanthem Subitum/Sixth Disease) (ICD-10: B08.20)\n\nClassic Presentation:\n1. High fever for 3-5 days (often >104\u00b0F) \u2713\n2. Sudden defervescence (fever \"breaks\") \u2713\n3. Rash appears as fever resolves (\"exanthem subitum\" = sudden rash) \u2713\n4. Blanching maculopapular rash, trunk > face/extremities \u2713\n5. Well-appearing child once afebrile \u2713\n6. Posterior cervical/occipital lymphadenopathy (Nagayama spots sometimes seen) \u2713\n\nEtiology: Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) or HHV-7\n- Most common in 6 months to 2 years, can occur up to 4-5 years\n- Spread by respiratory droplets, saliva\n- Incubation: 9-10 days\n\nDifferential Diagnoses Considered:\n- Measles: Ruled out - no cough, coryza, conjunctivitis (3 Cs), no Koplik spots, immunized\n- Rubella: Ruled out - different clinical pattern, immunized\n- Scarlet fever: Ruled out - no strawberry tongue, no sandpaper texture, no pharyngitis\n- Drug reaction: Ruled out - no new medications\n- Fifth disease (parvovirus B19): Different pattern (slapped cheek, lacy reticular rash)\n- Enteroviral exanthem: Possible, but classic roseola pattern fits better\n\n### Plan\nReassurance:\n1. This is roseola - a common, benign viral illness\n2. Rash is NOT contagious at this point (contagious during fever)\n3. Child is well and needs no specific treatment\n4. Rash will resolve spontaneously in 1-3 days\n5. No scarring, no complications expected\n\nNo Treatment Needed:\n6. No antiviral therapy needed\n7. No antibiotics needed (viral illness)\n8. Antipyretics no longer needed (afebrile)\n9. No antihistamines needed (not itchy)\n10. No topical treatments needed\n\nSupportive Care:\n11. Normal diet and activity\n12. Ensure adequate hydration\n13. Child can return to school/daycare - rash is not contagious\n\nAntipyretics (For Reference - If Fever Recurs):\n14. Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg q4-6h PRN fever\n15. Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg q6-8h PRN fever\n16. No aspirin (Reye syndrome risk with viral illness)\n\nFebrile Seizures (Counsel):\n17. Roseola is associated with febrile seizures (high, rapid fever)\n18. Did not occur in this child \u2713\n19. If child has febrile seizure in future: Benign in most cases, but seek evaluation\n\nComplications (Rare - Not Present):\n20. Watch for (though unlikely now):\n    - Encephalitis: Rare, would see altered mental status, seizures\n    - Thrombocytopenia: Rare\n21. This child is well, no concern for complications\n\nReturn Precautions:\n22. Return if:\n    - Fever returns and persists\n    - Rash becomes petechial/purpuric (doesn't blanch)\n    - Child becomes lethargic, ill-appearing\n    - Rash persists beyond 5-7 days\n    - New symptoms develop (cough, difficulty breathing, etc.)\n23. Most likely: Rash will fade without any intervention\n\nEducation:\n24. Roseola is very common - most children get it by age 2-3\n25. Lifelong immunity after infection\n26. May have had mild illness with fever, rash confirms the diagnosis\n27. Siblings may get it (incubation 9-10 days)\n\nFollow-up:\n28. No routine follow-up needed\n29. Call or return if concerns arise\n30. Regular well-child visit as scheduled"

ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY CONSULT STAT\n   - Septic arthritis of hip = Surgical emergency\n   - Needs urgent irrigation and drainage (I&D)\n2. NPO (patient will go to OR)\n3. IV access - large bore\n4. Labs drawn (done above)\n5. Blood cultures before antibiotics\n\nJoint Aspiration (Arthrocentesis):\n6. Hip aspiration should be performed (in OR usually for children)\n7. Aspirate sent for:\n   - Cell count with differential (WBC >50,000 with >90% PMNs suggests septic)\n   - Gram stain\n   - Culture (aerobic and anaerobic)\n   - Consider Kingella PCR (often culture-negative)\n8. Gross appearance: Purulent (cloudy, thick) suggests septic\n\nSurgical Drainage:\n9. Operative irrigation and drainage of hip joint\n   - Open arthrotomy (traditional) OR\n   - Arthroscopic drainage (if available, less invasive)\n10. Hip joint cannot be adequately drained by needle aspiration alone\n11. Goal: Remove purulent material, reduce bacterial load, decompress joint\n12.

If Kingella kingae suspected (age 6mo-4yrs):\n    - Cefazolin covers Kingella\n    - May add ceftriaxone for better coverage if highly suspected\n15. Adjust antibiotics based on culture results\n\nIf MRSA is Common Locally:\n16. Empiric Vancomycin + Ceftriaxone until cultures back\n17. MRSA septic arthritis: More aggressive, longer course needed\n\nMonitoring:\n18. Fever curve - expect improvement in 48-72 hours\n19. CRP trending down (better marker than ESR for response)\n20. Clinical improvement: Pain, ROM, weight-bearing\n21. Blood cultures: Monitor for clearance\n\nImaging Follow-up:\n22. Consider MRI if:\n    - Not improving as expected\n    - Concern for osteomyelitis (contiguous)\n    - Abscess formation\n23. Repeat ultrasound if concern for re-accumulation of fluid\n\nDuration of Antibiotics:\n24. IV antibiotics until:\n    - Afebrile 48-72 hours\n    - CRP improving\n    - Tolerating oral\n    - Clinically improved\n25. Transition to oral antibiotics:\n    - Cephalexin 100-150 mg/kg/day divided q6h, OR\n    - Clindamycin if MRSA\n26. Total duration: Minimum 3-4 weeks\n    - IV: ~1-2 weeks\n    - Oral: Remainder to complete course\n27. Kingella: May be shorter course (2-3 weeks) if rapid improvement\n\nComplications to Monitor:\n28. Avascular necrosis (AVN) of femoral head\n    - Hip is at high risk due to blood supply\n    - Delay in treatment increases risk\n29. Growth plate damage\n30. Chronic arthritis/joint damage\n31. Osteomyelitis (if spreads to bone)\n32. Recurrence\n\nPhysical Therapy:\n33. Once acute infection controlled:\n    - Gentle ROM exercises\n    - Non-weight bearing initially\n    - Gradual return to activity\n34. PT referral after discharge\n\nFollow-up:\n35. Inpatient until:\n    - Afebrile, CRP trending down\n    - Oral antibiotics tolerated\n    - Pain controlled, ROM improving\n36. Orthopedic follow-up in 1-2 weeks after discharge\n37. Infectious disease consult if complex course\n38. Serial CRP until normalized\n39. Long-term: Monitor for hip complications (AVN, growth issues)"

Friend at school was out sick with \"strep throat\" last week.\n\nPast Medical History: Healthy child, no prior strep infections\nMedications: Acetaminophen for fever\nAllergies: No known drug allergies (specifically no penicillin allergy)\nImmunizations: Up to date\nDevelopment: Normal\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Temperature: 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C)\n- Heart Rate: 110 bpm\n- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths/min\n- Blood Pressure: 98/62 mmHg\n- Weight: 25 kg\n- O2 Saturation: 99% on room air\n\nGeneral Appearance:\n- Mildly ill-appearing, but alert and interactive\n- No drooling, no stridor\n- No toxic appearance\n\nPhysical Examination:\n- HEENT:\n  - Oropharynx:\n    - Tonsillar hypertrophy (3+) bilaterally\n    - Tonsillar exudates (white-yellow patches on tonsils)\n    - Pharyngeal erythema\n    - Palatal petechiae present\n    - Uvula midline, not deviated\n    - No trismus\n  - TMs: Normal bilaterally\n  - Nasal: Clear, no discharge (absence of rhinorrhea supports strep)\n- Neck:\n  - Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (tender, 1.5 cm nodes bilaterally)\n  - No posterior cervical adenopathy\n  - Supple, no meningismus\n- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation, no cough during exam\n- Cardiovascular: Regular, no murmur\n- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly\n- Skin: No rash (no scarlet fever currently)\n\nDiagnostic Testing:\n- Rapid Strep Antigen Test: POSITIVE\n- Throat culture: Not needed (rapid strep positive is sufficient in children)\n\nCentor/McIsaac Criteria:\n- Tonsillar exudates \u2713\n- Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy \u2713\n- Fever \u2713\n- Absence of cough \u2713\n- Age 3-14 years: +1 point\nScore: 5 \u2192 High probability of GAS pharyngitis (testing confirms)\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Streptococcal Pharyngitis (Group A Streptococcal - GAS) (ICD-10: J02.0)\n\nDiagnosis Confirmed By:\n- Positive rapid strep antigen test\n- Clinical findings consistent with GAS pharyngitis\n\nImportance of Treatment:\n- Prevent suppurative complications (peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, cervical lymphadenitis)\n- Prevent acute rheumatic fever (most important)\n- Reduce symptom duration\n- Reduce transmission\n\n### Plan\nAntibiotic Treatment:\n1. First-line: Penicillin V (Oral)\n   - Dose: 250 mg PO BID or TID x 10 days (for children <27 kg)\n   - OR 500 mg PO BID x 10 days (if older/larger)\n   - For this patient (25 kg): 250 mg BID or TID x 10 days\n2. Alternative first-line: Amoxicillin\n   - 50 mg/kg once daily (max 1000 mg) x 10 days, OR\n   - 25 mg/kg BID (max 500 mg per dose) x 10 days\n   - For this patient: ~600 mg once daily or ~300 mg BID\n   - Often preferred in children (tastes better, once daily option)\n3. 10-day course is essential to eradicate GAS and prevent rheumatic fever\n\nIf Penicillin Allergy:\n4. Non-anaphylactic allergy:\n   - Cephalexin 20 mg/kg BID (max 500 mg per dose) x 10 days\n   - 10% cross-reactivity is overestimated; cephalosporins usually safe\n5. Anaphylactic/severe penicillin allergy:\n   - Azithromycin 12 mg/kg once daily (max 500 mg) x 5 days\n   - OR Clindamycin 7 mg/kg TID (max 300 mg per dose) x 10 days\n6. Azithromycin: Increasing resistance, use if true severe allergy\n\nIntramuscular Option:\n7. Benzathine Penicillin G IM:\n   - Single injection: 600,000 units IM (if <27 kg) or 1.2 million units IM (if \u226527 kg)\n   - Ensures compliance - no missed doses\n   - Consider if concerns about adherence\n   - Disadvantage: Painful injection\n\nSymptomatic Treatment:\n8. Antipyretics/analgesics:\n   - Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg q4-6h PRN (max 75 mg/kg/day)\n   - Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg q6-8h PRN (max 40 mg/kg/day)\n   - Excellent for sore throat pain relief\n9. Encourage fluids: Cold liquids, popsicles may soothe throat\n10. Soft, bland diet as tolerated\n11. Salt water gargles (if old enough to gargle without swallowing)\n12. Throat lozenges (if >4 years old, choking hazard younger)\n13. Humidifier for comfort\n\nContagion and School:\n14. Child is contagious until 24 hours after starting antibiotics\n15. May return to school after:\n    - On antibiotics for at least 24 hours, AND\n    - Afebrile, AND\n    - Feeling well enough\n16. Will be non-contagious after 24 hours of antibiotics\n\nExpected Course:\n17. Fever should resolve within 24-48 hours of antibiotics\n18. Sore throat improves within 24-48 hours\n19. Complete resolution in 3-5 days\n20. MUST complete full 10-day course even if feeling better\n    - Prevents rheumatic fever (antibiotics effective up to 9 days after symptom onset)\n\nWhen to Return:\n21. Return precautions:\n    - Fever >48-72 hours despite antibiotics\n    - Unable to swallow or drooling (concern for peritonsillar abscess)\n    - Difficulty breathing or stridor\n    - Severe neck pain or stiffness\n    - Rash develops (could be scarlet fever or drug reaction)\n    - Trismus (can't open mouth - abscess sign)\n    - Not improving or worsening\n22. If symptoms of peritonsillar abscess:\n    - Severe sore throat, \"hot potato\" voice\n    - Trismus, uvula deviation\n    - This is emergency - needs drainage\n\nComplications to Watch For:\n23. Suppurative complications (early):\n    - Peritonsillar abscess\n    - Retropharyngeal abscess\n    - Cervical lymphadenitis\n    - Mastoiditis, sinusitis\n24. Non-suppurative complications (late, 1-5 weeks after):\n    - Acute rheumatic fever: Fever, carditis, chorea, arthritis, rash\n    - Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis: Edema, hematuria, hypertension\n    - Antibiotics prevent rheumatic fever but NOT glomerulonephritis\n\nFamily Members/Close Contacts:\n25. Household contacts:\n    - Treat only if symptomatic\n    - Do not routinely test or treat asymptomatic contacts\n26. If recurrent strep in household: May need to culture/treat carriers\n\nFollow-up:\n27. No routine follow-up needed if improving\n28. No test of cure culture needed for uncomplicated strep\n29. Call or return if not improving in 48-72 hours\n30. Return for symptoms of complications\n31. If recurrent strep (\u22657 episodes/year): Consider tonsillectomy referral"

Started running cross-country in fall, practices 6 days/week. Also restricting food intake - skipping breakfast, eating small lunch, limited dinner. Reports eating ~1,000 calories/day. Drinks only water or diet drinks. Weighs herself daily. Feels stressed about school performance (straight A student) and making varsity team. Denies binge eating, denies purging (no vomiting, no laxatives). Denies feeling cold, constipation, fatigue (though common in restriction). No headaches, no visual changes.

Low energy availability (energy deficit) \u2713\n2. Menstrual dysfunction (amenorrhea) \u2713\n3. Low bone mineral density (likely, needs DEXA) - AT RISK\n\nDifferential Excluded:\n- Pregnancy: Negative test\n- Thyroid dysfunction: TSH normal\n- Hyperprolactinemia: Prolactin normal\n- PCOS: No hyperandrogenism, not overweight\n- Primary ovarian insufficiency: Age, low FSH argues against\n- Pituitary tumor: No headache, visual changes, galactorrhea\n\nEating Disorder Concern:\n- Meets criteria for at minimum: Atypical Anorexia Nervosa or full Anorexia Nervosa\n- Significant weight loss (16% of body weight)\n- BMI <18.5, now underweight\n- Restrictive eating\n- Body image distortion\n- Excessive exercise\n\n### Plan\nMultidisciplinary Approach (Essential):\n1. This patient requires a TEAM approach:\n   - Primary care/Adolescent medicine\n   - Eating disorder specialist (psychiatrist/psychologist)\n   - Dietitian with eating disorder experience\n   - Consider sports medicine for Female Athlete Triad\n2. Establish care with all team members\n\nNutritional Rehabilitation:\n3. GOAL: Restore energy availability and weight\n4. Dietitian referral - develop meal plan\n5. Target: Increase caloric intake gradually\n   - May need 2,000-3,000+ kcal/day depending on exercise\n   - Energy availability goal: >45 kcal/kg lean body mass/day\n6. Stop caloric restriction and weighing daily\n7. Adequate calcium (1,300 mg/day for adolescents) and Vitamin D (600-1,000 IU/day)\n8. Regular, balanced meals and snacks\n\nExercise Modification:\n9. REDUCE exercise load until weight and menses recover\n10. May need to temporarily stop competitive sports\n11. Discuss with coach (with patient's permission) if needed\n12. Return to full training only when:\n    - Weight restored\n    - Menstruation returns\n    - Medically cleared\n\nMenstrual Dysfunction:\n13. Amenorrhea will resolve with weight restoration and energy balance\n14. Do NOT give oral contraceptives to \"treat\" amenorrhea:\n    - OCPs mask the problem (withdrawal bleed is not true menstruation)\n    - Do not address underlying energy deficit\n    - May not protect bone density\n15. Return of spontaneous menses is marker of recovery\n16. May take 6-12 months after energy balance restored\n\nBone Health:\n17. DEXA scan to assess bone mineral density (BMD)\n    - Adolescents should be accruing bone; this patient is losing it\n    - Z-score interpretation in adolescents\n18. If low BMD:\n    - Primary treatment: Weight restoration and return of menses\n    - Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation\n    - No bisphosphonates in adolescents (not recommended)\n19. Long-term risk: Peak bone mass is achieved by late teens; bone loss now = osteoporosis risk later\n\nPsychological Treatment:\n20. Eating disorder therapy:\n    - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or\n    - Family-Based Treatment (FBT/Maudsley) - preferred for adolescents\n21. Address:\n    - Body image distortion\n    - Perfectionism, anxiety\n    - Relationship with food and exercise\n22. Screen for depression and anxiety (common comorbidities)\n23. May need psychiatric evaluation for medication (SSRIs) if mood symptoms\n\nMedical Monitoring:\n24. Weekly or biweekly weight checks initially\n25. Vital signs: HR, BP, orthostatics\n26. Labs if needed: Electrolytes (if any purging suspected), CBC\n27. Monitor for refeeding syndrome if severely malnourished (less likely outpatient)\n28. Bone density follow-up (DEXA in 1-2 years if abnormal or ongoing amenorrhea)\n\nLevel of Care:\n29. Current patient: May start with outpatient if:\n    - Medically stable (HR >50, no significant orthostasis)\n    - Willing to participate in treatment\n    - Family supportive and can supervise meals\n30. Consider higher level of care (partial hospitalization, residential) if:\n    - Not improving with outpatient\n    - Medical deterioration\n    - Severe eating disorder behaviors\n    - Suicidal ideation\n\nFamily Involvement:\n31. Family-Based Treatment involves parents in refeeding\n32. Educate parents on eating disorders\n33. Family therapy if needed\n34. Support for parents (caregiving is stressful)\n\nSchool/Sports:\n35. May need letter for school if missing for appointments\n36. Sports participation:\n    - May need to be restricted until medically cleared\n    - Work with school athletic trainer and coach\n    - Clearance criteria: Weight restored, vitals stable, menses returning\n\nAnticipatory Guidance:\n37. Recovery is possible and expected with treatment\n38. Eating disorders are serious but treatable\n39. Long-term health consequences of ongoing restriction: Osteoporosis, infertility, cardiac issues\n40. Menses will return when body is healthy\n\nFollow-up:\n41. Medical follow-up in 1-2 weeks\n42. Dietitian within 1 week\n43. Mental health intake ASAP (within 1-2 weeks)\n44. Weekly visits initially for weight monitoring\n45. Communicate with coach (with consent) regarding activity restrictions\n46. Close monitoring until stable and improving"

This child: Mild vomiting but now tolerating fluids\n   - Option 1: Admit for IV antibiotics initially, then switch to oral\n   - Option 2: Outpatient oral antibiotics with close follow-up\n\n3. Chosen plan: Outpatient oral antibiotics (child tolerating PO, non-toxic)\n\n4. First-line oral antibiotic:\n   - Cefixime 8 mg/kg PO daily (160 mg daily) x 10-14 days, OR\n   - Cephalexin 25-50 mg/kg/day divided TID-QID x 10-14 days, OR\n   - Amoxicillin-clavulanate 25-45 mg/kg/day divided BID x 10-14 days\n\n5.

Urine culture results:\n   - Check culture and sensitivities when available\n   - Adjust antibiotic if resistant organism\n\n10. Repeat urinalysis/culture:\n    - NOT needed routinely during treatment if responding\n    - NOT needed after treatment if asymptomatic\n\nImaging Workup (First Febrile UTI):\n\n11. AAP Guidelines (2-24 months) recommend renal ultrasound after first febrile UTI\n12. This child is older (5 years) but similar principles apply\n\n13. Renal and Bladder Ultrasound (RBUS):\n    - Recommended after first febrile UTI\n    - Can be done during admission or outpatient\n    - Evaluate for: Hydronephrosis, renal anomalies, abscess\n\n14. Voiding Cystourethrogram (VCUG):\n    - NOT routinely recommended after first febrile UTI\n    - Indicated if:\n      - Abnormal RBUS (hydronephrosis, scarring, other abnormalities)\n      - Recurrent febrile UTIs\n      - Atypical features (non-E.coli, poor response, mass, elevated creatinine)\n\n15. DMSA Scan:\n    - Gold standard for renal scarring\n    - Not routinely done after single UTI\n    - Consider if recurrent infections or concern for renal damage\n\n16. For this child:\n    - Order renal ultrasound\n    - VCUG only if ultrasound abnormal or recurrent UTIs\n\nVesicoureteral Reflux (VUR):\n\n17. VUR is present in ~30% of children with febrile UTI\n18. VCUG diagnoses VUR but is invasive\n19. Top-down approach: RBUS first, VCUG only if indicated\n20. If VUR found: Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered\n\nAntimicrobial Prophylaxis:\n\n21. NOT recommended routinely after first febrile UTI\n22. Consider if:\n    - High-grade VUR (grade IV-V)\n    - Recurrent febrile UTIs\n    - Bladder bowel dysfunction\n\n23. If prophylaxis needed:\n    - TMP-SMX at 1/3 to 1/2 treatment dose at bedtime\n    - Nitrofurantoin 1-2 mg/kg at bedtime\n\nBladder Bowel Dysfunction (BBD):\n\n24. Screen for:\n    - Constipation (major contributor to recurrent UTI)\n    - Voiding dysfunction (holding, infrequent voiding, incomplete emptying)\n\n25. Address constipation if present:\n    - Fiber, fluids, stool softeners\n    - Miralax if needed\n\n26. Voiding habits:\n    - Timed voiding (every 2-3 hours)\n    - Complete bladder emptying\n    - Adequate fluid intake\n    - Proper toilet positioning\n\nPatient/Parent Education:\n\n27. Complete the full course of antibiotics\n28. Encourage fluids\n29. Good perineal hygiene (wipe front to back)\n30. Avoid bubble baths\n31. Regular voiding\n32. Treat constipation\n33. Return if: Fever persists beyond 48-72 hours, vomiting, not drinking, worsening\n\nReturn Precautions:\n\n34. Not improving by 48-72 hours\n35. Vomiting, unable to take medications\n36. Worsening symptoms\n37. High fevers continuing\n38. Decreased urine output\n39. Lethargy\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n40. Phone call in 24-48 hours to check on progress\n41. Office visit in 1-2 weeks (end of treatment)\n42. Renal ultrasound (can schedule outpatient)\n43. Close monitoring for recurrent infections"

Prognosis:\n    - Excellent if no coronary involvement\n    - With IVIG treatment: <5% develop coronary aneurysms\n    - Most small aneurysms regress within 1-2 years\n    - Giant aneurysms: Increased risk of MI, need long-term management\n\nParent Education:\n\n27. Kawasaki disease is inflammation of blood vessels\n28. Main concern is heart (coronary arteries)\n29. Treatment reduces risk of heart problems\n30. Aspirin is essential, do not stop without doctor\n31. Watch for: Recurrent fever, irritability, chest pain\n32. Delay live vaccines for 11 months\n33.

NPO (nothing by mouth)\n2. NG tube: Decompress stomach, prevent further vomiting/aspiration\n\n3. IV Fluid Resuscitation:\n   - Bolus: NS 20 mL/kg (84 mL) IV\n   - Repeat as needed for dehydration\n   - Then maintenance: D5 1/2 NS at 1.5x maintenance\n   - Maintenance rate: 4 mL/kg/hr for first 10 kg = ~17 mL/hr x 1.5 = 25 mL/hr\n\n4. Potassium Replacement:\n   - Add KCl to IV fluids AFTER urine output confirmed\n   - 20-40 mEq/L of KCl in IV fluids\n   - Monitor K+ closely\n\n5. Electrolyte Correction Goals Before Surgery:\n   - Chloride >100 mEq/L\n   - Potassium >3.0 mEq/L\n   - HCO3 <30 mEq/L (or near normal)\n   - Adequate urine output (>1-2 mL/kg/hr)\n   - Correction usually takes 24-48 hours\n\n6. Do NOT take to surgery until electrolytes corrected:\n   - Metabolic alkalosis + anesthesia = high risk of apnea\n   - Hypokalemia = arrhythmia risk\n\nMonitoring:\n\n7. Strict I/O with urine output monitoring\n8. Electrolytes every 6-8 hours until normalized\n9. Blood glucose monitoring (risk of hypoglycemia)\n10. Weight daily\n\nSurgical Consultation:\n\n11. Pediatric surgery consultation\n12. Surgery after resuscitation and electrolyte correction\n\nDefinitive Treatment - Pyloromyotomy:\n\n13. Ramstedt Pyloromyotomy:\n    - Division of hypertrophied pyloric muscle\n    - Does NOT resect tissue, just splits muscle\n    - Laparoscopic approach preferred (if available)\n    - Open approach also effective\n\n14. Curative procedure with excellent outcomes\n\nPost-Operative Management:\n\n15. Feeding:\n    - Begin feeding 4-6 hours post-op\n    - Start with small volumes, advance as tolerated\n    - Some vomiting common initially (edema) - not a concern\n    - Usually feeding well within 24-48 hours\n\n16. Pain management: Acetaminophen\n\n17. Discharge:\n    - Once tolerating full feeds\n    - Usually 24-48 hours post-op\n    - Laparoscopic may be same-day or next-day discharge\n\nComplications (Rare):\n\n18. Incomplete myotomy (persistent vomiting - rare)\n19. Duodenal perforation (rare, requires repair)\n20. Wound infection\n21. Incisional hernia (rare with laparoscopic)\n\nPrognosis:\n\n22. Excellent\n23. Curative with pyloromyotomy\n24. No long-term issues expected\n25. Normal feeding and growth after recovery\n\nParent Education:\n\n26. Surgery is safe and curative\n27. Baby will need IV fluids to fix electrolytes before surgery (not emergent)\n28. Some vomiting after surgery is normal, will improve\n29. Baby should be feeding normally within 1-2 days post-op\n30. No dietary restrictions long-term\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n31. Pediatric surgery 1-2 weeks post-op\n32. Primary pediatrician for routine care\n33. Monitor weight gain (should resume normal)"

Orthopedic surgeon recommended it.\"\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Obesity (BMI 29, improved from 33)\n- Anxiety\n- No prior surgeries\n\nAllergies: Codeine (nausea)\nSocial: Non-smoker, no alcohol, works as medical receptionist (sedentary), single mother of 2 teenagers\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Blood Pressure: 128/82 mmHg\n- Weight: 172 lbs, Height: 5'6\", BMI: 27.8\n\nGeneral Appearance:\n- Well-appearing female\n- Shifts position frequently during interview (pain behavior)\n- No acute distress\n\nPhysical Examination:\n- Gait: Normal, no antalgic gait\n- Spine Inspection:\n  - Normal lumbar lordosis\n  - No scoliosis\n  - No step-off\n- Palpation:\n  - Tenderness over L4-5 paraspinals\n  - No midline bony tenderness\n  - Sacroiliac joint non-tender\n- Range of Motion:\n  - Flexion: Limited to 50% by pain\n  - Extension: Limited, reproduces pain\n  - Lateral bending: Mildly limited bilaterally\n- Neurological:\n  - Strength: 5/5 bilateral LE (hip flexion, knee extension, ankle DF/PF, great toe extension)\n  - Sensation: Intact L2-S1\n  - Reflexes: 2+ patellar, 2+ Achilles bilaterally\n  - Straight Leg Raise: Negative bilaterally (no radicular pain)\n- Special Tests:\n  - FABER: Negative bilaterally (hip/SI pathology less likely)\n  - Waddell signs: 0/5 (no non-organic signs)\n\nImaging:\n- MRI Lumbar Spine (6 months ago):\n  - L4-5: Broad-based disc herniation, left paracentral, moderate central canal stenosis\n  - Mild facet arthropathy L4-5, L5-S1\n  - No significant foraminal stenosis\n  - No nerve root impingement on left L5 (correlate clinically)\n  - Other levels: Mild degenerative changes, no significant pathology\n\nPsychosocial Assessment:\n- PHQ-9: 10 (moderate depression)\n- Fear-avoidance beliefs: Elevated (fear of movement, catastrophizing)\n- Work status: Modified duty\n- Support: Adequate (family nearby)\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Chronic Low Back Pain with Disc Herniation L4-5 (ICD-10: M51.16)\n\nFailed Conservative Management - Partially:\n- Has had PT, injections, medications - partial and temporary relief\n- Has NOT exhausted all conservative options:\n  - Inconsistent with home exercises\n  - Fear-avoidance beliefs not addressed\n  - Depression/anxiety contributing\n  - Could try more intensive rehab program\n\nSurgery Consideration (Spinal Fusion):\n- Surgeon recommended fusion for discogenic pain\n- However, patient has:\n  - No significant radiculopathy (SLR negative, no motor deficit)\n  - No neurological compromise\n  - Psychosocial factors (depression, fear-avoidance)\n  - Disc herniation but no clear nerve impingement on imaging\n\nPM&R Perspective:\n- Spinal fusion success rates for non-radicular chronic low back pain are variable (50-70%)\n- Risk of failed back surgery syndrome\n- Psychosocial factors predict poor surgical outcomes\n- Recommend optimizing conservative care before surgery\n\n### Plan\nRecommendation: Intensive Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation Before Surgery Decision\n\n1. Multidisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Program:\n   - Intensive, structured program (if available)\n   - Includes: PT, psychology, occupational therapy, pain education\n   - Duration: 3-4 weeks, daily participation\n   - Evidence-based for chronic low back pain\n   - Goal: Functional improvement, not just pain reduction\n\n2. If Formal Program Not Available:\n   - Intensive PT (2-3x/week) for 8-12 weeks\n   - Focus on: Core stabilization, McKenzie method, graded exercise\n   - Concurrent cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or pain psychology\n   - Home exercise compliance is CRITICAL\n\nPhysical Therapy:\n\n3. Specific PT Approach:\n   - Lumbar stabilization program\n   - Core strengthening (transversus abdominis, multifidus)\n   - Aerobic conditioning (walking, aquatic therapy)\n   - McKenzie exercises (directional preference)\n   - Gradual return to function\n\n4. Address Fear-Avoidance:\n   - Graded activity exposure\n   - Education: Hurt does not equal harm\n   - Movement is medicine\n   - Goal setting for functional activities\n\n5. Home Exercise Program:\n   - Must be consistent (currently inconsistent)\n   - Commit to daily exercises (15-20 minutes)\n   - Simple, progressive program\n   - Tracking/accountability (app, log)\n\nPsychological Treatment:\n\n6. Pain Psychology/CBT Referral:\n   - Essential for chronic pain with psychosocial factors\n   - Address depression (PHQ-9 = 10)\n   - Address catastrophizing, fear-avoidance\n   - Pain coping strategies\n   - Relaxation techniques, mindfulness\n\n7. Consider antidepressant:\n   - Duloxetine (Cymbalta) 30 mg daily, increase to 60 mg\n   - Dual benefit: Depression AND chronic pain (FDA approved for both)\n   - Can replace gabapentin if preferred\n   - SNRI helpful for chronic pain syndromes\n\nMedication Optimization:\n\n8. Current regimen is reasonable but can optimize:\n   - Add/Switch to Duloxetine 30-60 mg daily (for depression + pain)\n   - Continue gabapentin OR replace with duloxetine (avoid duplication)\n   - Continue NSAIDs PRN (reduce if able)\n   - Wean cyclobenzaprine (limited evidence for chronic use)\n\n9. Avoid:\n   - Long-term opioids (not recommended for chronic LBP, poor outcomes)\n   - Benzodiazepines\n   - Escalating medications without addressing function\n\nInterventional Options (If Not Already Exhausted):\n\n10. Epidural Steroid Injections:\n    - Has had 2 with temporary relief\n    - Could consider another series if radicular symptoms return\n    - Limit to 3-4 per year\n\n11. Facet Joint Interventions:\n    - Has facet arthropathy on MRI\n    - Consider diagnostic medial branch blocks\n    - If positive: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can provide 6-12 months relief\n\n12. Regenerative Medicine (Emerging):\n    - PRP, stem cell injections for disc: Limited evidence\n    - Not first-line, consider if interested\n\nWeight Management:\n\n13. Continue weight loss efforts:\n    - Already lost 15 lbs - excellent\n    - Goal: BMI <25 (lose 15 more lbs)\n    - Reduces mechanical load on spine\n    - Improves surgical outcomes if eventually needed\n\n14. Nutrition counseling referral if needed\n\nSleep:\n\n15. Address sleep disruption:\n    - Poor sleep worsens pain perception\n    - Sleep hygiene education\n    - Consider low-dose trazodone or melatonin\n    - Sleep study if apnea suspected (BMI 28)\n\nWork:\n\n16. Ergonomic assessment:\n    - Patient sits for work - sitting worsens pain\n    - Recommend sit-stand desk\n    - Frequent position changes (every 30 min)\n    - Lumbar support\n    - PT can guide work modifications\n\n17. Goal: Return to full duty\n\nSurgical Counseling:\n\n18. Spinal Fusion Discussion:\n    - Not opposed to surgery if truly indicated\n    - Current concerns:\n      - No radiculopathy or neurological deficit\n      - Psychosocial factors predict poor outcome\n      - Has not maximized conservative care\n    - Fusion outcomes for discogenic pain: 50-70% success\n    - Risk of failed back surgery syndrome: 10-40%\n    - Recommend optimizing rehab first\n\n19. Surgery More Clearly Indicated If:\n    - Progressive neurological deficit (not present)\n    - Cauda equina syndrome (not present)\n    - Failed comprehensive rehab with good compliance\n    - Imaging-clinical correlation (currently partial)\n\n20. Recommendation:\n    - Complete 3-6 months of intensive rehab\n    - Address psychosocial factors\n    - Reassess for surgery if no improvement\n    - Get second surgical opinion if proceeding\n\nAlternative Surgical Options:\n\n21. If surgery indicated in future:\n    - Microdiscectomy (less invasive than fusion) - if true radiculopathy\n    - Fusion: More for instability, deformity, failed discectomy\n    - Artificial disc replacement: Alternative to fusion in select patients\n    - Discuss with spine surgeon\n\nGoal Setting:\n\n22. Patient Goals (discuss and agree):\n    - Sit for 1 hour without severe pain\n    - Return to regular exercise (walking, low-impact)\n    - Return to full work duty\n    - Reduce pain to 3-4/10\n    - Reduce medication use\n\n23. Timeline:\n    - 3-6 months of intensive rehab\n    - Reassess function, pain, quality of life\n    - Make surgery decision with full information\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n24. PT: Start intensive program within 2 weeks\n25. Psychology: Referral for CBT/pain psychology\n26. PM&R follow-up: 6-8 weeks to assess progress\n27. If not improving after comprehensive rehab: Reconsider surgical consultation with better prognostic profile\n\nPatient Counseling:\n\n28. Explained:\n    - Chronic pain is complex - not just structural\n    - Surgery is not guaranteed to fix pain\n    - Best outcomes with comprehensive approach\n    - Psychosocial factors must be addressed\n    - Compliance with rehab is essential\n\n29. Patient understands and is willing to try intensive rehab before surgery decision\n\n30. Will revisit surgery discussion in 3-6 months"

If Oral Medications Insufficient:\n   - Intrathecal baclofen pump: Consider if high doses needed, good candidate\n   - Botulinum toxin injections: For focal spasticity (specific muscle groups)\n\n10. Stretching Program:\n    - Daily stretching to prevent contractures\n    - Caregiver training on ROM exercises\n    - PT to reinforce program\n\n11. Note: Some spasticity is beneficial (helps with transfers, prevents DVT) - goal is functional spasticity, not elimination\n\nNeurogenic Bladder:\n\n12. Current: Intermittent catheterization q4-6h + oxybutynin 5 mg TID\n13. 2 UTIs in 6 months - concerning\n14. UTI Prevention:\n    - Increase catheterization frequency to every 4 hours\n    - Adequate hydration (2-3 liters/day)\n    - Proper catheterization technique (clean technique)\n    - Cranberry supplements (limited evidence but low risk)\n    - D-mannose (some evidence for UTI prevention)\n    - Methenamine hippurate (Hiprex) - urinary antiseptic, can prevent UTI\n\n15. If Recurrent UTIs (\u22653/year):\n    - Consider low-dose prophylactic antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim)\n    - Risk of resistance - use judiciously\n    - Urology referral for evaluation\n\n16. Annual Monitoring:\n    - Renal ultrasound annually \u2713 (done, normal)\n    - Creatinine annually \u2713 (0.9, normal)\n    - Urinalysis if symptomatic (fever, increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia)\n\n17. Do NOT treat asymptomatic bacteriuria - common in SCI, does not require treatment\n\nNeurogenic Bowel:\n\n18. Current Program:\n    - Docusate 100 mg BID\n    - Senna 2 tabs HS\n    - Bisacodyl suppository every other day\n    - Duration: 1-1.5 hours - patient wants shorter\n\n19. Optimization:\n    - Timing: Same time each day, preferably after a meal (gastrocolic reflex)\n    - Position: Commode or toilet if possible (not in bed)\n    - Digital stimulation: To trigger reflex evacuation\n    - Ensure adequate stool consistency (not too hard, not too soft)\n\n20. To Shorten Bowel Program:\n    - Magic Bullet suppositories (faster acting than bisacodyl)\n    - Enemeez mini-enema (docusate mini-enema) - faster results\n    - Ensure diet has adequate fiber (25-30 g/day)\n    - Consistent schedule\n\n21. Goal: Bowel program <30-60 minutes\n\n22. Referral: SCI bowel program specialist or colorectal if persistent issues\n\nPressure Ulcer Prevention:\n\n23. History of Stage 2 sacral ulcer (healed)\n24. Prevention Critical:\n    - Weight shifts every 15-30 minutes in wheelchair\n    - Pressure-relieving wheelchair cushion (ROHO or similar)\n    - Inspect skin daily (mirror for areas can't see)\n    - Keep skin clean and dry\n    - Adequate nutrition (protein for skin healing)\n    - Avoid prolonged sitting on hard surfaces\n\n25. Wheelchair/Cushion Evaluation:\n    - Ensure proper cushion and seating system\n    - ATP (assistive technology professional) evaluation if needed\n    - Pressure mapping to identify high-risk areas\n\n26. Bed:\n    - Pressure-relieving mattress\n    - Turn/reposition at night (every 2-4 hours or as tolerated)\n\n27. Education: Caregiver and patient on skin inspection and prevention\n\nContracture Prevention:\n\n28. Mild hip and knee contractures developing (5-10\u00b0)\n29. Prevention:\n    - Daily ROM exercises (passive, full range)\n    - Stretching program (hamstrings, hip flexors, heel cords)\n    - Proper positioning in bed and wheelchair\n    - Standing frame: Recommend trial (benefits: bone health, contracture prevention, bowel/bladder function)\n\n30. PT Referral: For ROM program and standing frame evaluation\n\nBone Health:\n\n31. High risk for osteoporosis below level of injury\n32. Current: Vitamin D 2000 IU, Calcium 500 mg BID \u2713\n33. Vitamin D level: 35 - adequate \u2713\n34. Consider DEXA scan (hip and knee) at 1 year post-injury\n35. Weight-bearing: Standing frame, if possible (helps maintain bone density)\n36. Fall/fracture prevention: Transfers, wheelchair safety\n\nDVT Prevention:\n\n37. SCI patients at high risk for DVT, especially first year\n38. Compression stockings when seated\n39. ROM exercises, ankle pumps\n40. Adequate hydration\n41. Awareness of DVT signs: Leg swelling, warmth, calf pain\n42. May need anticoagulation if high-risk features (discuss if history of DVT)\n\nAutonomic Dysreflexia (AD) Prevention:\n\n43. T10 injury - at risk for AD (lesions above T6)\n44. Wait - T10 is below T6, so AD risk is LOW but not zero\n45. Educate on triggers and symptoms anyway:\n    - Triggers: Bladder distension, bowel impaction, pressure ulcers, tight clothing, UTI\n    - Symptoms: Sudden severe headache, hypertension, flushing, sweating above injury\n    - Management: Sit up, remove trigger, monitor BP, seek help if severe\n46. Emergency AD card to carry\n\nMood/Psychological Support:\n\n47. Adjusting but some hard days - normal part of SCI adjustment\n48. Screen: PHQ-9 = 8 (mild depression)\n49. Support:\n    - Continue monitoring\n    - Psychology/counseling referral (SCI-specialized if available)\n    - Peer support: Connect with SCI peer mentor or support group\n    - Family counseling (children, husband)\n50. If depression worsens: Already on duloxetine (helps mood and pain)\n51. Encourage adaptive recreation, return to meaningful activities\n\nSeuality and Fertility:\n\n52. T10 injury - reflexogenic arousal may be possible\n53. Fertility: Can achieve pregnancy (gynecology consultation if planning)\n54. Discuss: Sexuality, intimacy, reproductive options if patient interested\n55. Referral to SCI sexual health specialist if desired\n\nReturn to Work/Activity:\n\n56. Former teacher - interested in returning\n57. Vocational rehabilitation referral\n58. Workplace accommodations assessment\n59. Driving:\n    - Driving evaluation referral (with hand controls)\n    - Can drive with hand controls post-SCI\n    - Important for independence and work\n\n60. Adaptive Sports/Recreation:\n    - Wheelchair basketball, tennis, handcycling\n    - Connect with adaptive sports program\n    - Important for physical and mental health\n\nEquipment Review:\n\n61. Current: Manual wheelchair (appropriate for T10)\n62. Ensure proper fit and seating system\n63. May need power wheelchair for long distances or community (evaluate)\n64. Home modifications: Ramps, accessible bathroom (confirm in place)\n65. Vehicle: Hand controls for driving\n\nCaregiver Support:\n\n66. Husband is primary caregiver\n67. Assess caregiver burden\n68. Respite care options\n69. Caregiver training on transfers, ROM, skin care, bowel/bladder\n70. Family meeting if needed\n\nMedication Changes:\n\n71. Increase gabapentin 600 mg TID \u2192 800 mg TID\n72. Add tizanidine 2-4 mg at bedtime for night spasms\n73. Continue baclofen 20 mg TID (may increase if needed)\n74. Continue other medications unchanged\n\nReferrals:\n\n75. PT: ROM program, standing frame evaluation, spasticity management\n76. OT: ADLs, adaptive equipment, driving evaluation coordination\n77. Psychology: Adjustment counseling, pain coping\n78. Urology: If recurrent UTIs continue\n79. Vocational Rehabilitation: Return to work planning\n80. Adaptive Sports Program: Recreation and fitness\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n81. PM&R: 3-6 months\n82. Annual comprehensive evaluation (like today) ongoing\n83. Urgent return if: Pressure ulcer, severe UTI symptoms, autonomic dysreflexia, new pain/neurological changes\n\nPatient Education:\n\n84. Reviewed:\n    - Skin care and pressure ulcer prevention\n    - Bladder and bowel management\n    - Spasticity management\n    - Pain management strategies\n    - Signs of UTI, AD, DVT\n85. Provided resources: SCI support organizations, peer support contacts\n86. Encouraged questions and ongoing communication\n\nLong-Term Goals:\n\n87. Maximize independence in ADLs and mobility\n88. Effective pain and spasticity management\n89. Prevent complications (pressure ulcers, UTIs, contractures)\n90. Return to work and meaningful activities\n91. Optimize quality of life\n92.

FDA-Approved Medications for Fibromyalgia:\n   - Pregabalin (Lyrica): Currently using - side effects\n   - Duloxetine (Cymbalta): Previously tried briefly - consider retry\n   - Milnacipran (Savella): Not tried\n\n2. Option 1: Retry Duloxetine (Cymbalta)\n   - SNRI - treats pain, depression, anxiety\n   - Patient tried years ago, stopped after 2 weeks due to nausea/insomnia\n   - May tolerate better with slow titration:\n     - Start 20 mg daily x 1 week, then 30 mg x 1 week, then 60 mg\n     - Take in morning to minimize insomnia\n     - Take with food to minimize nausea\n   - Side effects: Nausea (usually transient), insomnia, dry mouth\n   - Advantage: May help depression, anxiety, and pain simultaneously\n   - Can potentially discontinue sertraline if duloxetine effective\n\n3. Option 2: Milnacipran (Savella)\n   - SNRI specific for fibromyalgia\n   - Not tried before\n   - Dosing: Start 12.5 mg daily, titrate up to 50 mg BID over 2 weeks\n   - Side effects: Nausea, constipation, hypertension, palpitations\n   - Does NOT treat depression (no serotonin reuptake at clinical doses)\n   - Would continue sertraline for depression\n\n4. Option 3: Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN)\n   - Off-label for fibromyalgia\n   - Dose: 1.5-4.5 mg at bedtime\n   - Mechanism: Anti-inflammatory, modulates opioid receptors\n   - Some evidence of benefit in fibromyalgia\n   - Minimal side effects\n   - Requires compounding pharmacy\n\n5. Option 4: Taper Pregabalin and Optimize Non-Pharmacological\n   - If patient wants to minimize medications\n   - Focus on exercise, sleep, CBT\n   - May lose some pain control initially\n\nMedication Plan (Agreed with Patient):\n\n6. Taper Pregabalin:\n   - Reduce from 150 mg BID to 100 mg BID x 1 week\n   - Then 75 mg BID x 1 week\n   - Then 50 mg BID x 1 week\n   - Then discontinue\n   - Monitor for withdrawal symptoms (insomnia, anxiety, nausea)\n\n7. Start Duloxetine (Retry):\n   - Start at low dose for tolerability\n   - Week 1: 20 mg daily (morning)\n   - Week 2: 30 mg daily\n   - Week 3+: 60 mg daily (target dose for fibromyalgia)\n   - Take with food\n   - Can overlap with pregabalin taper\n\n8. If Duloxetine Fails Again:\n   - Try milnacipran\n   - Or consider low-dose naltrexone\n   - Or consider combination therapy\n\n9. Continue Sertraline:\n   - Until duloxetine at therapeutic dose\n   - If duloxetine effective for mood, can taper sertraline (avoid serotonin syndrome)\n   - Cross-taper under supervision\n\nNon-Pharmacological Treatment (ESSENTIAL):\n\n10. Exercise (Most Important Non-Drug Treatment):\n    - Aerobic exercise proven effective for fibromyalgia\n    - Start low, go slow: 10 minutes walking, gradually increase\n    - Goal: 30 minutes moderate aerobic, 3-5x/week\n    - Aquatic therapy/pool exercise: Excellent for fibromyalgia\n    - Tai Chi, yoga: Evidence of benefit\n    - May initially worsen symptoms - persist through\n    - PT referral for guided exercise program\n\n11. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):\n    - Evidence-based for fibromyalgia\n    - Addresses pain coping, catastrophizing, sleep, mood\n    - Refer to pain psychologist or CBT therapist\n\n12. Sleep Hygiene:\n    - Critical for fibromyalgia\n    - Regular sleep schedule\n    - Avoid screens before bed\n    - Cool, dark, quiet room\n    - No caffeine after noon\n    - If sleep not improving, consider sleep study (rule out apnea)\n\n13. Sleep Medications (If Needed):\n    - Trazodone 25-50 mg at bedtime (non-habit forming)\n    - Melatonin 3-5 mg at bedtime\n    - Cyclobenzaprine 5-10 mg at bedtime (already using PRN - can make scheduled)\n    - Avoid: Benzodiazepines (long-term), zolpidem (dependency)\n\n14. Stress Reduction:\n    - Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)\n    - Meditation apps (Calm, Headspace)\n    - Deep breathing exercises\n    - Pacing activities (avoid boom-bust cycle)\n\nPhysical Therapy:\n\n15. PT Referral:\n    - For fibromyalgia-specific exercise program\n    - Aquatic therapy if available\n    - Manual therapy for myofascial trigger points\n    - Education on pacing, energy conservation\n\nSupplementary Treatments:\n\n16. Vitamin D:\n    - Check level if not recent\n    - Deficiency common and can worsen pain\n    - Supplement if <30 ng/mL\n\n17. Magnesium:\n    - Some evidence for fibromyalgia\n    - Magnesium glycinate 200-400 mg at bedtime\n    - May help sleep and muscle relaxation\n\n18. CoQ10:\n    - Some evidence for fatigue in fibromyalgia\n    - 100-200 mg daily\n\nOther Considerations:\n\n19. IBS Management:\n    - Fiber supplementation, probiotics\n    - Low-FODMAP diet trial\n    - If severe, GI referral\n\n20. Headaches:\n    - Tension-type likely related to fibromyalgia\n    - May improve with fibromyalgia treatment\n    - Consider prophylaxis if frequent (amitriptyline low-dose)\n\n21. Weight Management:\n    - BMI 32, gained 15 lbs on pregabalin\n    - Weight loss can improve fibromyalgia symptoms\n    - Stopping pregabalin may help weight\n    - Exercise program will help\n    - Nutrition counseling if interested\n\nAvoid:\n\n22. Long-term Opioids:\n    - NOT recommended for fibromyalgia\n    - Not effective, increase hyperalgesia, many risks\n    - Tramadol: Weak evidence, patient tried, didn't help\n\n23. Frequent NSAIDs:\n    - Patient using ibuprofen frequently\n    - Limited evidence for fibromyalgia (not inflammatory condition)\n    - GI and renal risks with chronic use\n    - Limit to occasional use only\n\n24. Excessive Investigations:\n    - Fibromyalgia is a clinical diagnosis\n    - Avoid repeated MRIs, blood tests if stable\n    - Can cause anxiety, false positives\n\nMultidisciplinary Pain Program:\n\n25. Consider referral to:\n    - Multidisciplinary pain program (if available)\n    - Includes: PT, OT, psychology, pain medicine, integrative medicine\n    - Best outcomes for chronic pain conditions\n\nWork/Function:\n\n26. Office administrator - sedentary job worsens symptoms\n27. Ergonomic assessment\n28. Frequent breaks, stretching\n29. Pacing of tasks\n30. If disability concerns, assess work modifications\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n31. Phone check in 2 weeks:\n    - Tolerating duloxetine titration?\n    - Pregabalin taper going okay?\n    - Any side effects?\n\n32. Office visit in 4-6 weeks:\n    - Assess response to new regimen\n    - Pain levels\n    - Sleep quality\n    - Mood\n    - Adjust medications as needed\n\n33. PT initiated within 2 weeks\n34. CBT/psychology referral\n\nPatient Education:\n\n35. Fibromyalgia Explained:\n    - Real condition - central sensitization\n    - Not progressive or degenerative\n    - Treatable but not curable\n    - Multimodal approach is best (medications + exercise + CBT + sleep)\n\n36. Expectations:\n    - Goal: Functional improvement, not pain-free\n    - 30-50% improvement is significant success\n    - Flares will occur - not a setback\n    - Patience with medication trials\n\n37. Self-Management:\n    - Pacing activities\n    - Regular exercise (even when painful)\n    - Sleep hygiene\n    - Stress management\n    - Patient is the expert on their body\n\n38. Resources:\n    - National Fibromyalgia Association\n    - Support groups (in-person or online)\n    - Educational materials provided\n\nPrescriptions:\n\n39. Duloxetine 20 mg #30, then 30 mg #30 (titration pack if available)\n40. Adjust pregabalin prescription for taper\n41. Continue sertraline 100 mg\n42.

        "output": "### Subjective\nPatient is a 35-year-old male presenting with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome for 8 months, right worse than left. Symptoms include numbness and tingling in thumb, index, middle, and radial half of ring finger bilaterally. Wakes at night with numbness - has to shake hands to get relief. Dropping objects due to weakness. Pain radiating to forearm. Symptoms worse with driving, typing, holding phone.\n\nPrevious Conservative Treatment:\n- Wrist splints at night: 3 months - some relief initially, now less effective\n- NSAIDs (ibuprofen): Minimal relief\n- Ergonomic modifications at work: Adjusted keyboard, mouse pad - some improvement\n- Physical/occupational therapy: 6 sessions - temporary relief\n\nNo prior corticosteroid injections. No prior surgery.\n\nOccupation: Software engineer - heavy computer use (8+ hours daily)\nHobbies: Guitar, cycling (leaning on handlebars)\n\nImpact:\n- Difficulty with typing (job requirement)\n- Dropping items\n- Sleep disrupted nightly\n- Cannot play guitar (significant loss)\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Obesity (BMI 31)\n- No diabetes\n- No thyroid disease\n- No rheumatoid arthritis\n\nMedications: Ibuprofen PRN\nAllergies: No known drug allergies\nSocial: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol, software engineer\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- Blood Pressure: 128/78 mmHg\n- Weight: 215 lbs, Height: 5'10\", BMI: 30.9\n\nGeneral Appearance:\n- Well-appearing male\n- Shaking hands intermittently during visit\n\nBilateral Upper Extremity Examination:\n\nRight Hand/Wrist:\n- Inspection: No thenar atrophy\n- Phalen's Test: Positive (symptoms within 30 seconds)\n- Tinel's Sign: Positive (tingling with tapping over carpal tunnel)\n- Durkan's Test (Carpal Compression): Positive\n- Sensation: Diminished light touch and two-point discrimination in median nerve distribution (thumb, index, middle, radial ring finger)\n- Thenar Strength: 4+/5 (slight weakness abductor pollicis brevis)\n- Grip Strength: Mildly reduced compared to left\n\nLeft Hand/Wrist:\n- Phalen's Test: Positive (60 seconds)\n- Tinel's Sign: Mildly positive\n- Durkan's Test: Positive\n- Sensation: Mildly diminished\n- Thenar Strength: 5/5\n\nCervical Spine: Full ROM, Spurling's negative (no radiculopathy)\nElbow: No tenderness at cubital tunnel (ulnar nerve normal)\n\nElectrodiagnostic Studies (EMG/NCS - Done 2 Weeks Ago):\n- Right Median Nerve:\n  - Sensory latency: 4.8 ms (prolonged; normal <3.5 ms)\n  - Motor latency: 5.2 ms (prolonged; normal <4.2 ms)\n  - Conduction velocity: Decreased across wrist\n  - Fibrillations in abductor pollicis brevis (denervation)\n  - Interpretation: MODERATE-SEVERE CTS\n\n- Left Median Nerve:\n  - Sensory latency: 4.0 ms (prolonged)\n  - Motor latency: 4.5 ms (mildly prolonged)\n  - No fibrillations\n  - Interpretation: MILD-MODERATE CTS\n\n- Ulnar nerves: Normal\n- Cervical radiculopathy: No evidence\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Bilateral Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - Right Moderate-Severe, Left Mild-Moderate (ICD-10: G56.00, G56.01, G56.02)\n\nConfirmed by:\n- Classic symptoms (numbness, tingling in median distribution, nocturnal symptoms)\n- Positive provocative tests (Phalen's, Tinel's, Durkan's)\n- Electrodiagnostic confirmation (EMG/NCS)\n\nFailed Conservative Treatment:\n- Splinting, NSAIDs, ergonomics, therapy - insufficient relief after 3+ months\n\nSeverity:\n- Right: Moderate-severe (EMG with denervation changes)\n- Left: Mild-moderate\n\n### Plan\nTreatment Options Discussion:\n\n1. Options for Right Wrist (Moderate-Severe):\n   a) Corticosteroid injection: May provide temporary relief but less likely to be curative given severity\n   b) Carpal tunnel release surgery: Definitive treatment, recommended given severity and failed conservative care\n\n2. Options for Left Wrist (Mild-Moderate):\n   a) Continue conservative measures\n   b) Corticosteroid injection: Good option for mild-moderate disease\n   c) Surgery: If injection fails or prefers definitive treatment\n\nRecommendation:\n\n3. Right Wrist:\n   - Recommend carpal tunnel release surgery\n   - Rationale:\n     - Moderate-severe on EMG with denervation (fibrillations)\n     - Failed conservative treatment\n     - Symptoms affecting work and quality of life\n     - Delay risks permanent nerve damage\n   - Injection less likely to provide long-term benefit at this severity\n\n4. Left Wrist:\n   - Offer corticosteroid injection\n   - If good response, can manage conservatively\n   - If poor response or progression, consider surgery later\n   - Can do bilateral surgery if preferred (some surgeons do staged)\n\nCorticosteroid Injection (Left Wrist):\n\n5. Technique:\n   - Ultrasound-guided recommended (higher accuracy, safety)\n   - Or landmark-guided (between palmaris longus and FCR, proximal to wrist crease)\n   - Medication: Triamcinolone 40 mg or methylprednisolone 40 mg + 1 mL lidocaine\n   - Avoid intraneural injection\n\n6. Expected Outcomes:\n   - 70-80% get initial relief\n   - Duration: Weeks to months (variable)\n   - May need repeat (limit to 2-3 per year)\n   - If good response: Can manage conservatively\n   - If poor response: Surgery indicated\n\n7. Risks of Injection:\n   - Infection (rare)\n   - Nerve injury (rare, <1%)\n   - Tendon injury\n   - Skin depigmentation\n   - Transient increase in blood glucose (if diabetic)\n\n8. Schedule injection: Today or next available\n\nSurgical Referral (Right Wrist):\n\n9. Referral to Hand Surgeon:\n   - For carpal tunnel release (right wrist)\n   - Provide EMG results and clinical findings\n\n10. Surgical Options:\n    - Open carpal tunnel release: Traditional, effective, small incision\n    - Endoscopic carpal tunnel release: Faster recovery, smaller incisions\n    - Both have similar long-term outcomes\n    - Discuss with surgeon\n\n11. Surgery Details:\n    - Outpatient procedure, local or regional anesthesia\n    - Transects transverse carpal ligament to decompress median nerve\n    - Recovery: 2-6 weeks for light activities, 6-12 weeks for full use\n    - Success rate: >90%\n\n12. Post-Surgical Rehabilitation:\n    - Finger ROM immediately\n    - Splint for 1-2 weeks (varies by surgeon)\n    - Hand therapy/OT for scar management, strengthening\n    - Gradual return to activities\n\nContinue Conservative Measures (Bilateral):\n\n13. Night Splints:\n    - Continue wearing wrist splints at night (neutral position)\n    - Prevents wrist flexion that compresses nerve\n\n14. Ergonomics:\n    - Keyboard and mouse at proper height\n    - Wrist rests (keep wrists straight, not bent)\n    - Take breaks every 30-60 minutes (stretch, shake hands)\n    - Ergonomic keyboard/mouse (split keyboard, vertical mouse)\n\n15. Activity Modification:\n    - Avoid prolonged wrist flexion or extension\n    - Avoid vibrating tools\n    - Cycling: Gel gloves, adjust handlebar position\n    - Guitar: May need to wait until symptoms improve\n\n16. Nerve Gliding Exercises:\n    - Median nerve glides (OT can teach)\n    - Tendon gliding exercises\n    - May help mobilize nerve, reduce symptoms\n\nWeight Management:\n\n17. BMI 31 - obesity is a risk factor for CTS\n18. Weight loss may reduce symptoms and improve outcomes\n19. Encourage healthy diet, exercise\n\nWork Considerations:\n\n20. Software engineer - heavy computer use\n21. May need work modifications or temporary light duty post-surgery\n22. Discuss with employer/HR about accommodations\n23. Typically return to desk work 1-2 weeks post-surgery (varies)\n\nExpected Timeline:\n\n24. Left wrist injection: Today/soon\n25. Right wrist surgery consultation: 1-2 weeks\n26. Right wrist surgery: Pending surgeon availability\n27. Recovery: 4-8 weeks for right hand function\n28. Reassess left wrist after injection response\n\nPost-Injection Instructions (Left Wrist):\n\n29. Ice for 24 hours (15 min on/off)\n30. May have temporary numbness from local anesthetic\n31. Steroid effect takes 48-72 hours\n32. Rest wrist for 24-48 hours (no heavy gripping)\n33. May have temporary flare before improvement\n34. Call if signs of infection (rare): Redness, warmth, fever\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n35. Surgery consultation: Schedule with hand surgeon\n36. PM&R/Physiatry follow-up:\n    - After injection (2-4 weeks): Assess response\n    - After surgery (4-6 weeks): Assess recovery\n37. Occupational therapy: Post-surgery for rehabilitation\n\nPatient Questions:\n\n38. \"What if I don't have surgery?\" (Right wrist)\n    - Progressive nerve damage possible\n    - Thenar atrophy (muscle wasting) can become permanent\n    - Sensory loss may not fully recover if delayed too long\n    - Recommend surgery given severity\n\n39. \"Can I do both wrists at same time?\"\n    - Some surgeons do bilateral simultaneously\n    - Others stage (one at a time) for functional use during recovery\n    - Discuss preference with surgeon\n\n40. \"How long until I can play guitar?\"\n    - After surgery: 6-12 weeks (depends on recovery)\n    - May have residual symptoms initially, improves over months\n    - Most patients return to hobbies\n\nPlan Summary:\n\n41. Left wrist: Corticosteroid injection today\n42. Right wrist: Hand surgery referral for carpal tunnel release\n43. Continue splinting, ergonomics, nerve glides\n44. Follow-up for reassessment\n45. Patient agrees with plan"

Goal: Slow, gradual reduction to minimize withdrawal and pain flare\n2. Rate: 10% reduction per month (safe, tolerable pace)\n3. Current: Oxycodone ER 40 mg BID + IR 10 mg PRN\n4. Month 1: Reduce ER to 30 mg BID (keeping IR same for now)\n5. Month 2: Reduce IR to 5 mg TID PRN\n6. Continue gradual reduction over 6-12 months\n7. May not achieve zero - functional improvement is goal\n8. Patient controls pace - can slow if intolerable\n\nWithdrawal Prevention:\n\n9. Clonidine 0.1 mg TID PRN for withdrawal symptoms (sweating, anxiety)\n10. Tizanidine at bedtime (already on - helps sleep and muscle relaxation)\n11. Hydroxyzine 25 mg PRN for anxiety during taper\n\nOptimize Non-Opioid Medications:\n\n12. Gabapentin: Currently 600 mg TID - can increase to 800 mg TID if needed\n13. Duloxetine: 60 mg - effective dose, continue\n14. Consider adding: \n    - Buprenorphine patch (Butrans) 10 mcg/hr as transition from full agonist\n    - Or buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual if appropriate\n15. Topical: Lidocaine patches to low back\n16. Meloxicam: Continue if tolerated (renal, GI monitoring)\n\nInterventional Options:\n\n17. Epidural steroid injection series if not recent\n18. Radiofrequency ablation (lumbar medial branch) if facet-mediated component\n19. Spinal cord stimulator: Failed trial - not candidate\n20. Intrathecal pump: May reconsider if opioid reduction not tolerated\n\nPhysical/Functional Rehabilitation:\n\n21. PT referral: Focus on function not pain elimination\n22. Aquatic therapy: Reduces weight-bearing stress\n23. Pacing strategies: Alternate sitting, standing, walking\n24. Gentle aerobic conditioning\n25. Core stabilization (within tolerance)\n\nPsychological Support:\n\n26. Pain psychology referral:\n    - CBT for chronic pain\n    - Address opioid reduction fears and coping\n    - Depression management\n    - Acceptance and commitment therapy\n27. Increase duloxetine to 90 mg if depression worsens during taper\n\nLifestyle:\n\n28. Weight loss: BMI 34 - significant contributor to spine pain\n    - Goal: Lose 10-15% body weight\n    - Nutrition referral\n    - As mobility improves, increase activity\n29. Sleep: Continue CPAP, optimize sleep hygiene\n30. TENS: Continue for pain relief\n\nMonitoring During Taper:\n\n31. Frequent follow-up: Monthly during active taper\n32. Monitor for:\n    - Withdrawal symptoms\n    - Pain flare\n    - Depression worsening\n    - Function (prioritize over pain score)\n33. UDS periodically to ensure compliance\n34. PDMP check each visit\n35. Patient can call between visits if struggling\n\nEducation:\n\n36. Explained:\n    - Slow taper is safe and tolerable\n    - Pain may temporarily increase then stabilize\n    - Function often improves as opioid dose decreases (OIH)\n    - Not a punishment - a health optimization strategy\n37. Patient motivated and committed\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n38. PM&R: 4 weeks for taper check\n39. Pain psychology: Within 2 weeks\n40. PT: Initiate within 1 week\n41. Continue current surgeon follow-up\n\nSummary:\n- FBSS on 100 MME/day x 8 years\n- Patient-requested opioid taper: 10% per month\n- Optimize non-opioid medications\n- Pain psychology for coping\n- PT for function\n- Monthly monitoring during taper"

Optimized conservative care\n2. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT)\n3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection\n4. Surgical release (last resort)\n\n### Plan\nOptimized Conservative Care:\n\n1. Stretching (MUST BE CONSISTENT):\n   - Plantar fascia stretch: 3x/day, 10 reps, hold 30 sec\n   - Gastrocnemius stretch: 3x/day, hold 30 sec each leg\n   - Soleus stretch: 3x/day, hold 30 sec\n   - Before getting out of bed in morning - stretch first\n\n2. Night splint: Retry dorsiflexion night splint\n   - Maintains stretch overnight\n   - Use consistently for 3 months\n   - Start with shorter duration if uncomfortable (2-3 hours initially)\n\n3. Orthotics: Continue custom orthotics, ensure proper fit\n   - Consider heel cups with cushioning\n   - Wear supportive shoes at all times (no barefoot, no flat shoes)\n\n4. Ice: Rolling frozen water bottle under foot 15 min after activity\n\n5. Physical therapy referral:\n   - Supervised stretching program\n   - Iontophoresis\n   - Ultrasound\n   - Manual therapy\n   - Strengthening (intrinsic foot muscles)\n\nAdvanced Treatment Options:\n\n6. Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (ESWT):\n   - Non-invasive, acoustic waves to heel\n   - Stimulates healing\n   - Series of 3-5 treatments\n   - 60-80% success in chronic cases\n   - Insurance coverage variable\n\n7. Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Injection:\n   - Patient's own blood, concentrated platelets\n   - Inject into plantar fascia origin\n   - Promotes healing via growth factors\n   - Evidence: Moderate - may be superior to corticosteroid long-term\n   - Cost: Often not covered by insurance ($500-1500)\n   - Recovery: Avoid significant activity 2-4 weeks\n\n8. Comparison - PRP vs Corticosteroid:\n   - Corticosteroid: Quick relief but short-lived, risk of fat pad atrophy, fascia rupture with repeated injections\n   - PRP: Slower onset but potentially more durable, promotes healing vs suppressing inflammation\n\nRecommendation:\n\n9. Start with optimized conservative care:\n   - Consistent stretching (critical)\n   - Night splint retry\n   - PT for 4-6 weeks\n   - If failure: Consider ESWT or PRP\n\n10. PRP injection: Reasonable option given:\n    - Chronic symptoms (1 year)\n    - Multiple failed treatments\n    - Temporary response to steroids (not wanting repeated steroids)\n    - Can proceed if patient prefers after understanding cost and evidence\n\n11. Plan: Trial optimized conservative for 6-8 weeks, then reassess for PRP or ESWT if not improving\n\nWeight Management:\n\n12. BMI 31 - weight is significant contributor\n13. Goal: Lose 10-15% body weight (20-25 lbs)\n14. Reduces mechanical load on plantar fascia\n15. Nutrition counseling referral\n16. Low-impact exercise (swimming, cycling, upper body) while foot heals\n\nWork Modifications:\n\n17. 12-hour nursing shifts are challenging\n    - Supportive shoes with orthotics at all times\n    - Compression socks may help\n    - Take sitting breaks when possible\n    - Consider temporary work modification if available\n\nMedications:\n\n18. Topical diclofenac gel: Apply to heel 3-4x/day (avoids GI side effects)\n19. Limit oral NSAIDs due to GI upset\n20. Acetaminophen PRN for pain\n\nAvoid:\n\n21. No repeated corticosteroid injections (already had 2)\n    - Risk of fat pad atrophy, fascia rupture increases\n22. No barefoot walking\n23. Avoid high-impact activity until resolved\n\nSurgery (Last Resort):\n\n24. Plantar fascia release surgery:\n    - Only if failed all conservative measures for 6-12 months\n    - 70-90% success but risk of complications\n    - Not indicated currently\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n25. PT: 2x/week for 4-6 weeks\n26. PM&R: 6-8 weeks to reassess\n27. If not improving: Schedule for PRP or ESWT\n\nPatient Education:\n\n28. Plantar fasciitis is self-limiting in most cases (12-18 months)\n29. Consistent stretching is the most important intervention\n30. Weight loss will significantly help\n31. Patience required - chronic cases take longer to heal"

No trauma. Works as dental hygienist - repetitive overhead/forward reaching.\n\nPrevious Treatment:\n- Physical therapy: 6 weeks, 12 sessions - some improvement initially, plateaued\n- NSAIDs (ibuprofen): Partial relief\n- Ice: Minimal effect\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Otherwise healthy\n- No prior shoulder problems\n\nMedications: Ibuprofen 400 mg TID PRN\nAllergies: NKDA\nSocial: Dental hygienist x 20 years, right-hand dominant, non-smoker\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 122/78, HR 70\n\nRight Shoulder Examination:\n- Inspection: No asymmetry, no atrophy\n- Palpation: Tender anterolateral acromion, supraspinatus insertion\n- ROM:\n  - Active forward flexion: 140\u00b0 (with pain)\n  - Active abduction: 135\u00b0 (painful arc 60-120\u00b0)\n  - External rotation: 50\u00b0 (mildly limited)\n  - Internal rotation: Hand to T12 (mildly limited)\n- Strength:\n  - Supraspinatus (empty can test): 4+/5 with pain\n  - Infraspinatus (external rotation): 5/5\n  - Subscapularis: 5/5\n- Special Tests:\n  - Neer's impingement test: Positive (pain with passive flexion)\n  - Hawkins-Kennedy test: Positive (pain with internal rotation in flexion)\n  - Jobe's test: Positive (weakness/pain with resistance)\n  - Cross-body adduction: Mildly positive (AC joint irritation)\n  - Drop arm: Negative (no rotator cuff tear)\n- Cervical spine: Full ROM, Spurling's negative\n\nImaging:\n- X-ray (obtained 2 months ago): Type II acromion, no significant OA, no calcification\n- MRI: Not done yet\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Right Shoulder Impingement Syndrome (ICD-10: M75.40)\n\n- Subacromial impingement likely\n- Rotator cuff involvement (supraspinatus - tendinopathy vs partial tear)\n- Partial response to PT but plateaued after 6 weeks\n- Contributing factors: Repetitive overhead work, Type II acromion\n\nDifferential:\n- Subacromial impingement (most likely)\n- Rotator cuff tendinopathy/partial tear\n- AC joint pathology (contributory)\n- Biceps tendinopathy\n- MRI would clarify\n\n### Plan\nCorticosteroid Injection:\n\n1. Subacromial injection recommended:\n   - Failed 6 weeks of conservative care\n   - Diagnostic and therapeutic\n   - If excellent response: Confirms impingement etiology\n2. Injection technique:\n   - Subacromial space, lateral or posterior approach\n   - Medication: Triamcinolone 40 mg + 3 mL 1% lidocaine\n   - Ultrasound-guided if available (more accurate)\n3. Post-injection:\n   - May have temporary flare (24-48 hours)\n   - Effect takes 48-72 hours\n   - Rest from overhead activity for 48 hours\n   - Can return to PT when comfortable\n4. Expected outcome: 50-70% significant relief if impingement is primary\n5. If no response: Consider MRI, re-evaluate diagnosis\n6. Limit to 3 injections per year in same location\n\nPhysical Therapy (Continued):\n\n7. Resume PT after injection takes effect (1 week)\n8. Modified PT approach:\n   - Rotator cuff strengthening (especially external rotators, supraspinatus)\n   - Scapular stabilization exercises (lower trapezius, serratus anterior)\n   - Posterior capsule stretching\n   - Avoid painful impingement positions during exercises\n   - Progress slowly\n9. PT frequency: 2x/week for 4-6 more weeks\n\nHome Exercise Program:\n\n10. Daily exercises:\n    - Pendulum exercises\n    - External rotation strengthening (side-lying or with band)\n    - Prone horizontal abduction (I, Y, T exercises)\n    - Scapular squeezes, wall slides\n11. Avoid overhead lifting, reaching behind back until improved\n12. Ice after exercises if sore\n\nWork Modifications:\n\n13. Dental hygienist - repetitive reaching is contributor\n14. Modify:\n    - Adjust patient chair height to minimize overhead reaching\n    - Frequent position changes\n    - Microbreaks to stretch\n    - Consider ergonomic evaluation\n15. May need temporary work modification if severe\n\nImaging:\n\n16. MRI if:\n    - No response to injection\n    - Concern for rotator cuff tear (weakness, acute injury)\n    - Symptoms persistent after conservative care\n17. Current plan: Proceed with injection and PT, MRI if no improvement in 4-6 weeks\n\nMedications:\n\n18. Continue NSAIDs PRN (limit to 2 weeks after injection as steroid helps inflammation)\n19. Topical diclofenac as alternative\n20. Acetaminophen for pain as needed\n\nSurgery Consideration:\n\n21. Subacromial decompression (arthroscopic):\n    - If failed 3-6 months comprehensive conservative care\n    - Including PT, injections, activity modification\n    - Not indicated currently\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n22. PM&R: 4-6 weeks after injection to assess response\n23. If good response: Continue PT, home exercises\n24. If poor response: MRI, possible orthopedic referral\n\nPatient Education:\n\n25. Impingement is common and treatable\n26. PT and exercise are key to long-term resolution\n27. Injection is not a cure - reduces inflammation to allow PT to work\n28. Work ergonomics important for prevention\n29. Most patients recover without surgery"

Natural history: 80-90% of cervical radiculopathy improves with conservative care in 8-12 weeks\n2. No surgical urgency - no motor deficit, no myelopathy\n\nPhysical Therapy:\n\n3. PT referral (Priority):\n   - Cervical traction (may decompress nerve root)\n   - Manual therapy\n   - Postural training (forward head posture from computer use)\n   - Cervical stabilization exercises\n   - Nerve gliding (neural flossing)\n   - Avoid provocative positions\n4. Frequency: 2x/week for 6-8 weeks\n\n5. Home program:\n   - Posture correction (chin tucks)\n   - Gentle ROM (avoid extension)\n   - Nerve glides (PT to teach)\n   - Avoid looking up, reaching overhead\n\nMedications:\n\n6. NSAIDs: Continue ibuprofen 600 mg TID with food for 2 weeks\n   - Consider GI protection (omeprazole 20 mg daily) if prolonged use\n7. Neuropathic pain: Add gabapentin 100 mg TID, titrate to 300 mg TID as tolerated\n   - Helps nerve pain, numbness, tingling\n8. Muscle relaxant: Cyclobenzaprine 5 mg at bedtime if spasm present\n9. Short-term oral steroid (optional):\n   - Prednisone taper (e.g., Medrol Dosepak) - can reduce acute inflammation\n   - May provide rapid relief\n   - Side effects: Insomnia, mood changes, glucose elevation\n   - Consider if symptoms severe\n\nActivity Modification:\n\n10. No heavy lifting, especially overhead (no gym, no bench press)\n11. Avoid cervical extension activities\n12. Ergonomics at work:\n    - Monitor at eye level\n    - Supportive chair\n    - Frequent breaks (every 30-60 min, stretch)\n13. Sleep: Cervical pillow, avoid stomach sleeping\n14. May return to light activity as tolerated (walking, stationary bike)\n\nEpidural Steroid Injection:\n\n15. Cervical epidural steroid injection (CESI):\n    - Indicated if: Symptoms persist after 4-6 weeks of PT and medications\n    - Technique: Interlaminar or transforaminal approach\n    - Purpose: Reduce inflammation around nerve root\n    - Expected: 50-70% significant improvement\n    - May need 1-3 injections\n16. Current plan: Start conservative care, consider injection if not improving in 4-6 weeks\n\nSurgical Indications (Not Met Currently):\n\n17. Progressive motor weakness\n18. Myelopathy (cord compression symptoms)\n19. Failed comprehensive conservative care (3-6 months)\n20. Current: No surgical indication\n\nRed Flags - Seek Immediate Care If:\n\n21. New or progressive weakness (especially triceps, hand grip)\n22. Gait problems, balance issues\n23. Bladder or bowel dysfunction\n24. Bilateral arm symptoms\n\nPrognosis:\n\n25. Young patient, no motor deficit, short duration - excellent prognosis\n26. Most resolve with conservative care\n27. Full return to gym possible after resolution (may need to modify technique)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n28. PM&R: 4-6 weeks to assess response\n29. If improving: Continue conservative care\n30. If not improving: Proceed with cervical epidural injection\n31. PT: Start within 1 week\n\nPatient Education:\n\n32. Disc herniations often resorb over time\n33. Conservative care is very effective for radiculopathy\n34. PT and activity modification are key\n35. Surgery is last resort, rarely needed\n36. May take 2-3 months for full resolution\n37. Return to gym gradually, avoid provocative movements long-term"

        "output": "### Subjective\nPatient is a 40-year-old male with right lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) for 8 months. Pain 6/10 over lateral elbow, worsens with gripping, lifting, turning doorknobs, typing. Initially started after home improvement project (repeated hammering). Tried multiple treatments without lasting relief. Works as plumber - requires gripping and tool use. Pain affecting work and considering disability. Dominant right hand.\n\nPrevious Treatments:\n- Rest from aggravating activities: 2 months - mild improvement, returned with activity\n- NSAIDs (naproxen): 6 weeks - partial relief\n- Physical therapy: 8 weeks - eccentric exercises, stretching - temporary relief\n- Counterforce brace: Used daily - minimal help\n- Corticosteroid injection x2: Relief for 4-6 weeks each, recurrence\n- Ice, massage: Minimal effect\n\nPast Medical History: Healthy\nMedications: Naproxen PRN\nAllergies: NKDA\nSocial: Plumber, right-hand dominant, non-smoker\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 128/78, HR 72\n\nRight Elbow Examination:\n- Inspection: No swelling, no erythema\n- Palpation: Point tenderness over lateral epicondyle and common extensor tendon origin\n- ROM: Full elbow ROM (0-145\u00b0 flexion)\n- Provocative Tests:\n  - Cozen's test: Positive (pain with resisted wrist extension)\n  - Mill's test: Positive (pain with passive wrist flexion, elbow extended)\n  - Maudsley's test (resisted middle finger extension): Positive\n- Grip strength: Reduced right vs left\n- Medial epicondyle: Non-tender\n- Neurovascular: Intact\n\nImaging:\n- X-ray: Normal, no calcification\n- MRI (3 months ago): Tendinopathy of common extensor origin with partial tear, no full-thickness tear\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Chronic Lateral Epicondylitis (Tennis Elbow), Right, Refractory to Conservative Treatment (ICD-10: M77.11)\n\n- 8-month duration\n- MRI: Tendinopathy with partial tear\n- Failed: PT, bracing, NSAIDs, 2 corticosteroid injections\n- Significantly affecting occupation\n\nTreatment Options at This Stage:\n1. Continued conservative care (eccentric exercise, ESWT)\n2. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection\n3. Surgical release\n\n### Plan\nDiscussion of Options:\n\n1. Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (ESWT):\n   - Non-invasive, acoustic waves\n   - Evidence: Moderate for chronic lateral epicondylitis\n   - Series of 3-5 treatments\n   - Can try before PRP or surgery\n\n2. Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Injection:\n   - Patient's own blood, concentrated platelets\n   - Inject into tendon origin\n   - Mechanism: Growth factors promote healing\n   - Evidence: \n     - Better than corticosteroid at 1 year\n     - Some studies show benefit for chronic tendinopathy\n     - Not universally effective\n   - Cost: $500-1500 (often not covered by insurance)\n   - Recovery: Significant increase in pain 1-2 weeks, then gradual improvement over 6-12 weeks\n   - Need to stop NSAIDs 1 week before and 4 weeks after (interferes with healing response)\n   - Avoid aggravating activities 4-6 weeks\n\n3. Surgery (Lateral Epicondyle Release):\n   - Debridement and release of common extensor origin\n   - Arthroscopic or open\n   - Success rate: 80-90% for refractory cases\n   - Recovery: 4-6 months for full return to work\n   - Reserved for: Failure of all conservative measures including PRP\n   - Risks: Infection, nerve injury, persistent pain, weakness\n\nRecommendation:\n\n4. Try PRP injection before surgery:\n   - Reasonable next step for chronic tendinopathy\n   - Avoids surgical risks and recovery time\n   - If fails, surgery remains option\n\n5. PRP Procedure Plan:\n   - Ultrasound-guided injection\n   - Blood draw: 30-60 mL\n   - Centrifuge to concentrate platelets\n   - Inject 3-5 mL PRP into tendon under ultrasound\n   - May fenestrate tendon (needle tenotomy) to stimulate healing\n\n6. Pre-PRP:\n   - Stop NSAIDs (naproxen) 1 week before\n   - Use acetaminophen only for pain\n\n7. Post-PRP Protocol:\n   - Days 1-3: Rest, ice, elevation, significant pain expected\n   - Week 1-2: Light ROM, no resistance\n   - Week 2-4: Gentle stretching\n   - Week 4-6: Begin eccentric strengthening\n   - Week 6-12: Progressive strengthening\n   - Full activity: 3-6 months\n   - No NSAIDs for 4-6 weeks (inhibit platelet function)\n\n8. Work:\n   - May need light duty or modified work for 4-6 weeks\n   - Discuss with employer\n   - Gradual return to full duty\n\nIf PRP Fails:\n\n9. Allow 6 months for full PRP effect\n10. If no improvement: Surgical referral for lateral release\n11. Arthroscopic preferred if available (faster recovery)\n\nAlternatives:\n\n12. Can try ESWT first (less invasive than PRP, covered by some insurers)\n13. Prolotherapy: Limited evidence\n14. Autologous blood injection: Less concentrated than PRP, some evidence\n\nOngoing:\n\n15. Continue counterforce brace during activities\n16. Ice after activity\n17. Acetaminophen for pain (avoid NSAIDs peri-PRP)\n18. Stretching and eccentric exercises (after initial PRP rest period)\n\nErgonomics:\n\n19. Plumber - modify grip, tool handles\n20. Padded grips, larger handles reduce strain\n21. Alternate hands when possible\n22. Frequent breaks\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n23. Schedule PRP if patient agrees (after 1 week off NSAIDs)\n24. Follow-up 6-8 weeks post-PRP to assess response\n25. If improved: Gradual return to full activity\n26. If not improved at 6 months: Surgical consultation\n\nPatient Education:\n\n27. PRP takes time - 3-6 months for full effect\n28. May have significant pain first 1-2 weeks (expected)\n29. Must avoid NSAIDs or effect diminished\n30. Not guaranteed to work but reasonable before surgery\n31. Surgery has good outcomes if PRP fails"

Quetiapine at bedtime addresses this\n11. If not using quetiapine: Trazodone 50-100mg or melatonin\n12. Sleep regulation critical - sleep deprivation triggers mania\n\nMonitoring on Lithium:\n13. Baseline and ongoing labs:\n    - Lithium level (5-7 days after each dose change, then every 3-6 months stable)\n    - Renal function (BUN, Creatinine) every 6 months\n    - TSH every 6 months (already on levothyroxine)\n    - Calcium (hyperparathyroidism risk)\n14. Signs of toxicity: Tremor, nausea, diarrhea, ataxia, confusion\n15. Maintain hydration, consistent sodium intake\n16. Caution with NSAIDs, diuretics, ACE inhibitors (increase lithium levels)\n\nAddress Medication Adherence:\n17. Explore reasons for stopping lithium:\n    - Side effects (weight, tremor, thirst, polyuria)\n    - Felt well (\"I don't need it anymore\")\n18. Psychoeducation: Bipolar is chronic, lifelong treatment needed\n19. Discuss consequences of nonadherence (this relapse)\n20. Strategies: Pill organizer, phone reminders, family support\n21. Consider long-acting injectable (aripiprazole, risperidone) if recurrent nonadherence\n\nSide Effect Management:\n22. For lithium tremor: Propranolol 10-20mg BID\n23. For weight: Diet, exercise, consider aripiprazole (weight-neutral)\n24. For polyuria/polydipsia: Monitor, consider amiloride if severe\n\nDepressive Episode Prevention:\n25. Lithium has anti-suicide properties\n26. Lamotrigine addition if depressive episodes predominate\n27. Avoid antidepressants without mood stabilizer (can trigger mania)\n\nPsychotherapy:\n28. Refer for bipolar-specific therapy:\n    - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Bipolar\n    - Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)\n    - Family-focused therapy\n29. Mood charting - track daily mood, sleep, medications\n30. Identify early warning signs of episodes\n\nLifestyle - Circadian Rhythm Stabilization:\n31. Regular sleep-wake schedule (critical)\n32. Avoid sleep deprivation\n33. Avoid alcohol and drugs\n34. Regular daily routines\n35. Stress management\n36. Limit stimulants (caffeine)\n\nSafety Planning:\n37. Safety plan for depressive episodes:\n    - Husband has control of medications (prevent overdose)\n    - Warning signs\n    - Crisis contacts (988)\n    - Emergency plan\n38. Financial safeguards (husband monitors credit cards during episodes)\n39. Advance directive for psychiatric treatment\n\nFamily Involvement:\n40. Husband included in treatment planning\n41. Education about bipolar disorder\n42. Recognize early warning signs\n43. NAMI Family-to-Family program\n\nFollow-up:\n44. Psychiatry in 1 week for lithium level and clinical assessment\n45. Weekly visits until stable\n46. Therapy weekly\n47. Long-term maintenance treatment (indefinite)"

No appetite stimulants or weight gain medications initially\n20. Avoid QTc-prolonging medications\n21. If severe anxiety interfering with eating:\n    - Consider low-dose olanzapine (helps anxiety, may aid weight gain)\n    - Avoid SSRIs until weight restored (less effective when malnourished)\n22. Stool softener for constipation (docusate)\n23. Warm blankets for hypothermia\n\nNutrition Team:\n24. Dietitian consultation\n25. Meal plan development\n26. Supervised meals (100% completion required)\n27. Ensure replacement if meals refused or vomited\n28. Oral supplements (Ensure, Boost) if unable to complete meals\n29. NG tube if refusing/unable to eat (may require mental health hold)\n\nBehavioral Interventions:\n30. Supervised meals (30-45 minutes to complete)\n31. No bathroom for 1 hour after meals (prevent purging)\n32. No exercise during medical stabilization\n33. Room restriction if not compliant\n34. Limit weighing - patient should not see weight initially\n\nPsychiatric Treatment:\n35. Eating disorder-specific therapy once medically stable:\n    - Family-Based Treatment (FBT/Maudsley) - most effective for young patients\n    - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Eating Disorders (CBT-E)\n    - Adolescent-Focused Therapy\n36. Individual therapy addressing:\n    - Body image distortion\n    - Perfectionism\n    - Anxiety\n    - Distorted cognitions about food/weight\n37. Family therapy essential\n38. Group therapy (when appropriate level of care)\n\nTransition Planning:\n39. After medical stabilization, transfer to:\n    - Residential eating disorder treatment facility, OR\n    - Partial hospitalization program (PHP), OR\n    - Intensive outpatient program (IOP)\n40. Duration: Often months of treatment needed\n41. Do not discharge home without intensive support\n\nBone Health:\n42. DEXA scan (likely osteopenia/osteoporosis)\n43. Calcium 1200mg + Vitamin D 1000IU daily\n44. Bisphosphonates not typically used in young women\n45. Weight restoration is primary treatment for bone loss\n46. Menses will return with weight restoration\n\nMedical Follow-up:\n47. Amenorrhea: Will resolve with weight restoration (typically when 90% IBW)\n48. Do not give oral contraceptives to restore menses (masks recovery marker)\n49. Monitor LFTs (can rise during refeeding)\n50. Cardiac function: Echo if prolonged course\n\nLegal/Ethical Considerations:\n51. If patient refuses treatment:\n    - Psychiatric hold may be necessary (danger to self)\n    - Capacity evaluation\n    - Consider guardianship if prolonged refusal\n52. Patient is adult - involve parents with consent\n\nGoals:\n53. Short-term: Medical stability, safe refeeding\n54. Medium-term: Weight restoration to healthy BMI (18.5-24.9)\n55. Long-term: Recovery from eating disorder, normalized eating, menses return\n\nFollow-up:\n56. Inpatient until medically stable\n57. Transfer to eating disorder-specific program\n58. Long-term outpatient treatment for years\n59. Eating disorders have high relapse rates - ongoing support essential"

Consider propranolol 10-20mg PRN for situational anxiety\n14. Anger management skills in therapy\n\nAvoid:\n15. Benzodiazepines (worsens PTSD outcomes, addiction risk with AUD)\n16. Chronic opioids (addiction risk)\n\nPsychotherapy - Essential for PTSD:\n17. Evidence-based trauma-focused therapy:\n    - Prolonged Exposure (PE) - gold standard\n    - Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) - gold standard\n    - EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)\n18. Refer to VA mental health or PTSD specialty clinic\n19. Weekly sessions for 12-16 weeks typically\n20. Therapy should not wait for alcohol abstinence (treat concurrently)\n\nAlcohol Use Disorder Treatment:\n21. Motivational interviewing about alcohol use\n22. Explain: Alcohol worsens PTSD symptoms long-term\n23. Medication-Assisted Treatment:\n    - Naltrexone 50mg daily (reduces cravings, blocks reward)\n    - Can use with SSRI\n    - Helpful for concurrent PTSD/AUD\n    - Alternative: Acamprosate if liver concerns\n24. Consider intensive outpatient program for AUD\n25. AA or SMART Recovery meetings\n\nTBI Consideration:\n26. History of mild TBI - can have overlapping symptoms with PTSD\n27. Neuropsychological testing if cognitive concerns persist after PTSD treatment\n28. TBI clinic referral if needed\n\nVeteran-Specific Resources:\n29. VA mental health services\n30. Vet Center (community-based counseling)\n31. Peer support from other veterans\n32. VA PTSD specialty programs\n33. Wounded Warrior Project, other VSOs\n34. Couples counseling (wife involved if patient willing)\n\nFamily/Relationship:\n35. Couples therapy to address relationship strain\n36. Psychoeducation for wife about PTSD\n37. Family therapy may benefit children\n38. PTSD affects whole family - support for spouse\n\nOccupational:\n39. May need work accommodations\n40. FMLA if needed for treatment\n41. Vocational rehab through VA if work difficulties persist\n\nLifestyle:\n42. Regular exercise (reduces PTSD symptoms)\n43. Limit caffeine (worsens arousal)\n44. Sleep schedule regulation\n45. Social connection (combat isolation)\n46. Mindfulness/relaxation techniques\n47. Reduce alcohol\n\nMonitoring:\n48. PCL-5 at each visit to track progress\n49. PHQ-9 for depression\n50. AUDIT for alcohol use\n51. Suicide risk assessment ongoing\n52. Side effect monitoring\n\nFollow-up:\n53. Psychiatry in 2 weeks for medication check\n54. Therapy intake appointment\n55.

Parents report he \"can't sit still\" - constantly fidgeting, getting out of seat, running around. Talks excessively, interrupts others, blurts out answers before questions are finished. Difficulty waiting his turn in games and lines. Very impulsive - acts without thinking, runs into street, climbs on furniture.\n\nAlso has significant attention problems: Difficulty sustaining attention on tasks (homework takes 3 hours with constant redirection), easily distracted, forgetful (leaves lunch at home, forgets assignments), loses things frequently (3rd jacket this year, loses pencils daily), difficulty following multi-step instructions, doesn't seem to listen when spoken to, avoids homework, careless mistakes in schoolwork.\n\nSymptoms present in multiple settings:\n- Home: Parents exhausted, constant supervision needed\n- School: Teacher reports same concerns, calls home frequently, desk moved away from others\n- Sports: Can't follow rules in soccer, gets distracted during games\n\nSymptoms present before age 12 (parents note he was \"always like this,\" but worsened with school demands).

No tics, no oppositionality beyond frustration. No mood symptoms. Good sleep, good appetite.\n\nDevelopmental History: Met milestones on time, no speech delay, no ASD concerns\nMedical History: None, no seizures, no head injuries\nMedications: None\nAllergies: No known drug allergies\nBirth History: Full-term, uncomplicated\nFamily History: Father diagnosed with ADHD as adult (untreated), maternal uncle with ADHD, no bipolar, no tics\nSocial: 2nd grade, lives with both parents and younger sister (age 5), parents married, no custody issues, no trauma history, no screen time excessive by report\n\nEducation: Average IQ (tested - 102), no learning disability identified, 504 plan in place, may need IEP\n\n### Objective\nBehavior Observation (during 45-minute interview):\n- General: Friendly, talkative, in constant motion\n- Activity: Out of seat 6 times, fidgeting constantly, touching objects in office\n- Attention: Difficulty sustaining attention, easily distracted by noises outside, needed frequent redirection\n- Speech: Interrupts, talks excessively, blurts answers\n- Impulsivity: Grabbed items off desk, answered before questions finished\n- Affect: Bright, appropriate\n- No tics observed\n- No oppositional behavior\n- No signs of anxiety during evaluation (though may mask)\n- Grossly intact cognition\n\nPhysical Examination:\n- Vital Signs: BP 102/65, HR 80, Height 52\" (50th %ile), Weight 58 lbs (50th %ile)\n- General: Healthy appearing, well-nourished\n- Cardiovascular: Regular rate/rhythm, no murmur\n- Neurological: No tics, no abnormal movements, grossly normal\n\nRating Scales:\n- Vanderbilt Parent Rating Scale: \n  - Inattention: 8/9 symptoms positive (score 2-3)\n  - Hyperactivity-Impulsivity: 7/9 symptoms positive\n  - Performance: Impaired\n  - No significant ODD, conduct, or anxiety symptoms\n- Vanderbilt Teacher Rating Scale:\n  - Inattention: 7/9 symptoms positive\n  - Hyperactivity-Impulsivity: 8/9 symptoms positive\n  - Performance: Impaired (grades below ability)\n  - Teacher comments: \"Cannot sit still, calls out, distracts others, forgets assignments\"\n- Conners Rating Scale: Elevated on hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity subscales\n\nPsychological Testing (review):\n- IQ: 102 (average)\n- No learning disability identified\n- Achievement consistent with ability (suggests ADHD causing underperformance)\n\n### Assessment\nPrimary Diagnosis: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Combined Presentation, Moderate (ICD-10: F90.2)\n\nDSM-5 Criteria Met:\n- Inattention: \u22656 symptoms for \u22656 months (8 symptoms present) \u2713\n- Hyperactivity-Impulsivity: \u22656 symptoms for \u22656 months (7 symptoms present) \u2713\n- Several symptoms present before age 12 \u2713\n- Symptoms in 2+ settings (home and school) \u2713\n- Clear impairment in functioning \u2713\n- Not better explained by another disorder \u2713\n\nSubtype: Combined (both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity criteria met)\nSeverity: Moderate (symptoms and impairment present but manageable)\n\nDifferentials Considered and Ruled Out:\n- Anxiety: Some worry present but not impairing, likely secondary to ADHD struggles\n- Learning Disability: Testing shows average ability, no specific LD\n- Autism Spectrum: No social communication deficits, no restricted interests/repetitive behaviors\n- Oppositional Defiant Disorder: Some frustration but not pervasive opposition\n- Mood Disorder: No mood symptoms\n- Tic Disorder: No tics observed or reported\n\n### Plan\nParent/Patient Education:\n1. ADHD is a neurobiological disorder, not a behavior problem or parenting issue\n2. Treatment is very effective\n3. ADHD is lifelong but manageable\n4. Multimodal treatment is best (medication + behavioral interventions)\n5. Provide ADHD resources: CHADD, Understood.org, ADDitude magazine\n\nMedication - First-Line (Stimulants):\n6. Start methylphenidate (most studied in children):\n   - Begin: Methylphenidate ER 18mg (Concerta) every morning\n   - OR Methylphenidate 5mg (Ritalin) in morning, trial immediate release first\n7. Take with breakfast, no afternoon dosing of long-acting to preserve sleep\n8. Titrate: Increase by 9mg (Concerta) or 5-10mg every 1-2 weeks\n9. Target: Symptom control with minimal side effects\n10. Typical therapeutic dose: 1 mg/kg/day (this patient ~27mg)\n\nAlternative Stimulant Options:\n11. Amphetamine-based: Adderall XR, Vyvanse (if methylphenidate inadequate/not tolerated)\n12. Mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall XR) 5-10mg every morning\n13. Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) 20-30mg every morning\n\nMonitoring on Stimulants:\n14.

Height and weight at each visit (plot on growth chart)\n16. Heart rate and blood pressure at each visit\n17. No routine EKG needed unless cardiac history/family history\n\nCardiovascular Considerations:\n18. Pre-treatment: Normal exam, no cardiac history, no sudden death in family\n19. No contraindication to stimulants\n20. Refer to cardiology if: Murmur, syncope, family history of sudden death, cardiomyopathy\n\nNon-Stimulant Options (Second-Line):\n21. If stimulants fail or not tolerated:\n    - Atomoxetine (Strattera): Start 0.5 mg/kg/day, increase to 1.2 mg/kg/day\n    - Viloxazine (Qelbree)\n    - Alpha-2 agonists: Guanfacine ER (Intuniv), Clonidine ER (Kapvay)\n22. May combine alpha-2 agonist with stimulant for added benefit or to counter side effects\n\nBehavioral Therapy (Essential):\n23. Parent training in behavior management:\n    - Positive reinforcement\n    - Token economy/reward systems\n    - Clear, consistent rules and consequences\n    - Structured routines\n    - Break tasks into smaller steps\n24. Child-focused interventions:\n    - Organizational skills training\n    - Social skills group\n25. Behavioral therapy referral\n\nSchool Interventions:\n26. 504 Plan: Already in place, review accommodations:\n    - Preferential seating (front of class, away from distractions)\n    - Extended time on tests\n    - Breaks as needed\n    - Written instructions (not just verbal)\n    - Reduced homework load\n    - Check-in/check-out for assignments\n    - Fidget tools\n27. Consider IEP if more support needed (OHI category)\n28. Communication notebook between home and school\n29. Meet with school psychologist/counselor\n\nHome Strategies:\n30. Consistent daily routines\n31. Homework: Same time, same place, minimize distractions, short breaks\n32. Visual schedules and checklists\n33. Organizational systems (color-coded folders)\n34. Timer for tasks\n35. Positive reinforcement > punishment\n36. Pick your battles\n37. Regular exercise (helps ADHD symptoms)\n38. Adequate sleep (critical)\n39. Limit screen time\n\nDiet and Supplements:\n40. No special diet proven for ADHD\n41. Healthy, balanced diet is best\n42. Some children sensitive to artificial colors/additives (limit if noted)\n43. Fish oil/omega-3: Limited evidence, not harmful\n44. No sugar restriction needed (myth)\n\nAddress Comorbidities:\n45. Anxiety: Monitor, address with therapy if impairing\n46. Low self-esteem: Build on strengths, acknowledge successes\n47. Social skills: May benefit from social skills group\n\nParent Support:\n48. CHADD (Children and Adults with ADHD) local chapter\n49. Parent support groups\n50. Respite care if overwhelmed\n51. Consider parental ADHD evaluation (father likely has ADHD)\n\nFollow-up:\n52. Return in 2-4 weeks for medication check\n53. May need phone check-in at 1 week when starting medication\n54. Repeat Vanderbilt scales (parent and teacher) to monitor response\n55. Ongoing monitoring every 3-6 months when stable\n56.

For now, use relaxation techniques when distressed\n16. Don't force exposures before therapy starts\n\nCoping Strategies:\n\n17. Grounding techniques for flashbacks:\n    - 5-4-3-2-1 (5 things you see, 4 hear, 3 touch, 2 smell, 1 taste)\n    - Focus on present moment\n18. Deep breathing exercises\n19. Mindfulness apps (Calm, Headspace)\n20. Social support - reconnect with safe people\n\nAvoid:\n\n21. Benzodiazepines - NOT recommended for PTSD (can worsen outcomes, impair exposure therapy)\n22. Alcohol/substances (common self-medication, worsens PTSD)\n\nWork/Function:\n\n23. May need temporary accommodations (flexible schedule)\n24. Therapy is intensive - prioritize it\n25.

Current consumption: 1 pint of vodka daily (approximately 10-12 standard drinks). Last drink: 8 hours ago. Has tried to quit multiple times on own but develops severe withdrawal. History of withdrawal seizure 2 years ago when tried to stop cold turkey. Tremors starting now. Motivation: \"Wife threatening to leave, doctor says liver is damaged.\"\n\nSymptoms Currently:\n- Mild tremor\n- Anxiety\n- Sweating\n- Craving\n- No visual or auditory hallucinations\n- No confusion\n\nDrinking Pattern:\n- First drink in morning to stop shaking (eye-opener)\n- Drinks throughout day\n- Tolerance: Needs more to feel effects\n- Withdrawal symptoms when not drinking\n\nPast Medical History: Hypertension, fatty liver disease\nPast Psychiatric History: Depression (untreated), no prior AUD treatment\nMedications: Lisinopril 20 mg daily (not taking regularly)\nAllergies: NKDA\nSocial: Divorced, lives alone, works in construction, tobacco 1 ppd\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs:\n- BP: 152/96 mmHg (elevated)\n- HR: 98 bpm (elevated)\n- Temperature: 98.8\u00b0F\n- RR: 18\n\nGeneral: Appears anxious, mild diaphoresis, resting tremor of hands\n\nNeurological:\n- Tremor: Mild-moderate, bilateral hands\n- Oriented x3\n- No asterixis\n- No nystagmus\n- Gait: Steady\n\nAbdomen: Mild RUQ tenderness, hepatomegaly palpable\n\nMental Status:\n- Alert, oriented x3\n- Anxious mood\n- No hallucinations\n- No confusion\n- Insight: Good - recognizes problem, wants help\n\nCIWA-Ar Score: 12 (moderate withdrawal)\n- Nausea: 1\n- Tremor: 3\n- Sweating: 2\n- Anxiety: 3\n- Agitation: 1\n- Tactile disturbances: 0\n- Auditory disturbances: 0\n- Visual disturbances: 0\n- Headache: 1\n- Orientation: 0\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, with Physiological Dependence (ICD-10: F10.20)\n\nSeverity: Severe (\u22656 DSM-5 criteria)\nWithdrawal Risk: HIGH (history of withdrawal seizure, heavy daily use, CIWA 12)\n\nWithdrawal Complications Risk:\n- Prior withdrawal seizure (HIGH RISK for recurrence)\n- Heavy prolonged use\n- Elevated vitals\n\nRecommendation: INPATIENT MEDICALLY SUPERVISED DETOXIFICATION\n\n### Plan\nLevel of Care:\n\n1. Recommend inpatient detoxification (medical admission or detox facility)\n2. Rationale:\n   - History of withdrawal seizure = high risk for complicated withdrawal\n   - Needs monitored benzodiazepine taper\n   - 24-hour medical supervision\n3. If patient refuses inpatient: Close outpatient detox with daily monitoring (higher risk)\n\nMedical Detoxification Protocol:\n\n4. Benzodiazepine for withdrawal:\n   - Symptom-triggered: Lorazepam or chlordiazepoxide based on CIWA-Ar\n   - Fixed-schedule alternative: Chlordiazepoxide 50 mg q6h day 1, taper over 5-7 days\n5. Seizure prophylaxis: Benzodiazepines provide coverage\n6. Thiamine 500 mg IV x 3 days, then 100 mg PO daily (prevent Wernicke's)\n7. Folate 1 mg daily\n8. Multivitamin daily\n9. IV fluids if dehydrated\n10. Monitor: Vitals q4h, CIWA-Ar q4h, neuro checks\n\nIf Outpatient Detox (Patient Refuses Inpatient):\n\n11. High risk - not ideal given seizure history\n12. Would require:\n    - Daily visits for CIWA assessment\n    - Family/friend present 24/7\n    - Prescribed chlordiazepoxide taper at home with close supervision\n    - ER immediately for confusion, hallucinations, seizure\n13. Gabapentin 300 mg TID can be adjunct (reduces cravings, helps mild withdrawal)\n\nMedications for Alcohol Use Disorder (After Detox):\n\n14. Naltrexone 50 mg daily:\n    - Reduces cravings and heavy drinking days\n    - Start after detox complete (7-10 days abstinent)\n    - Contraindicated if on opioids\n    - Check LFTs first (avoid if severe liver disease)\n    - Alternative: Vivitrol (naltrexone) 380 mg IM monthly for adherence\n\n15. Acamprosate 666 mg TID:\n    - Reduces cravings\n    - Safe in liver disease (renally cleared)\n    - Alternative to naltrexone\n\n16. Disulfiram 250-500 mg daily:\n    - Aversive therapy - causes severe reaction if drink\n    - Requires motivated patient\n    - Contraindicated in severe liver/heart disease\n    - Not first-line\n\nPsychosocial Treatment:\n\n17. Essential - medication alone is insufficient\n18. Options:\n    - Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) - 12-step program\n    - SMART Recovery (non-12-step)\n    - Individual counseling (CBT, motivational enhancement)\n    - Intensive outpatient program (IOP)\n    - Residential treatment (28-day program)\n\n19. Recommend IOP or residential treatment after detox\n\nMedical Issues:\n\n20. Liver disease: Check LFTs, hepatic panel\n21. Labs: CBC, CMP, LFTs, GGT, lipase, PT/INR, Vitamin D, B12\n22. Hepatology referral for fatty liver/possible cirrhosis evaluation\n23. Hypertension: Resume lisinopril once stable\n24. Tobacco: Discuss cessation after alcohol stabilized\n\nDepression:\n\n25. History of untreated depression\n26. May improve with sobriety\n27. Reassess mood after 2-4 weeks of abstinence\n28. Start antidepressant if persistent depression\n\nImmediate Plan:\n\n29. Today: Arrange inpatient detox admission\n30. If refuses: Start chlordiazepoxide taper with daily visits, very close monitoring\n31. Thiamine 100 mg IM now, then PO\n32. Return immediately if: Confusion, hallucinations, seizure, worsening tremor\n33. Do NOT stop drinking suddenly without medical supervision (risk of seizure, DTs)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n34. After detox: Establish with addiction medicine or psychiatry\n35. Start naltrexone or acamprosate\n36. Connect with support group/IOP\n37. PCP follow-up for medical issues\n\nPatient Education:\n\n38. Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening - needs medical supervision\n39. Recovery is a process - relapse is common but treatable\n40. Medication + support groups = best outcomes\n41. Sobriety will improve liver, blood pressure, mood, relationships"

Psychiatric hospitalization recommended:\n   - First episode psychosis = inpatient evaluation standard of care\n   - Safety (patient lacks insight, may act on delusions)\n   - Comprehensive workup\n   - Medication initiation with monitoring\n   - Psychoeducation for family\n\n2. If patient refuses voluntary admission:\n   - May require involuntary commitment if danger to self/others or gravely disabled\n   - Currently grave disability (not caring for self, impaired judgment)\n\n3. If admission delayed, acute agitation management:\n   - Verbal de-escalation first\n   - PO: Olanzapine 5-10 mg + lorazepam 1-2 mg\n   - IM if needed: Haloperidol 5 mg + lorazepam 2 mg + diphenhydramine 50 mg\n\nMedical Workup (Rule Out Organic Causes):\n\n4.

Brain MRI: Rule out structural lesion, especially first episode\n\n6. Consider EEG if seizure concern\n\n7. Lumbar puncture if suspected encephalitis (no fever/meningismus currently)\n\nAntipsychotic Initiation:\n\n8. Second-generation antipsychotic preferred for first episode:\n   - Risperidone 1-2 mg daily, titrate to 2-4 mg\n   - OR Aripiprazole 5-10 mg daily, titrate to 10-15 mg\n   - OR Olanzapine 5-10 mg daily (more sedating, weight gain)\n\n9. Start low, go slow in first episode (more sensitive to side effects)\n\n10. Monitor for:\n    - Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)\n    - Metabolic effects (weight, glucose, lipids)\n    - Sedation\n    - QTc prolongation\n\nFirst Episode Psychosis Special Considerations:\n\n11. Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) affects prognosis - treat early\n12. First episode patients often respond to lower doses\n13. Higher side effect sensitivity\n14. 10-15% may have single episode and recover\n15. Family involvement crucial\n\nFamily Psychoeducation:\n\n16. Explain psychosis, likely diagnosis, treatment\n17. Reduce expressed emotion (criticism, hostility worsen outcomes)\n18. Discuss prognosis (variable, better with early treatment)\n19. Warning signs of relapse\n20. NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) resources\n\nFollow-Up (After Inpatient Stabilization):\n\n21. Outpatient psychiatry within 1 week of discharge\n22. First Episode Psychosis program (if available - best outcomes)\n23. Supported employment when stable\n24. Continued family involvement\n25. Long-acting injectable antipsychotic consideration for adherence\n\nSubstance Use:\n\n26. Strongly advise against cannabis use (worsens psychosis, especially in schizophrenia)\n27. Counsel on substance avoidance\n\nDisposition:\n\n28. Patient to be evaluated for psychiatric admission today\n29. If voluntary: Admit to psychiatric unit\n30. If refuses and meets criteria: Initiate involuntary commitment\n31. Parents in agreement with plan\n\nDocumentation:\n\n32.

Once medically stable:\n    - Transfer to eating disorder treatment program (residential or PHP)\n    - Individual therapy: CBT-E (enhanced CBT for eating disorders), FBT if adolescent\n    - Nutritional counseling with ED-trained dietitian\n    - Family therapy (especially for young patients)\n\n14. Medication considerations:\n    - SSRIs (fluoxetine) may help with comorbid depression/anxiety\n    - NOT effective for core anorexia symptoms until weight restored\n    - Avoid in severely malnourished (can prolong QTc)\n    - Start after medical stabilization and some weight gain\n\nPurging Interventions:\n\n15. Monitor electrolytes closely (purging depletes potassium)\n16. Potassium replacement if low\n17. Behavioral strategies in treatment\n18. Dental referral for erosion\n\nAmenorrhea:\n\n19. Secondary to hypothalamic suppression from malnutrition\n20. Will return with weight restoration (typically at ~90% ideal body weight)\n21. DEXA scan for bone density (osteoporosis risk in AN)\n22. Calcium 1200 mg + Vitamin D 800 IU daily\n\nMedical Monitoring:\n\n23. Weekly weights (in gown, after voiding - prevent water loading)\n24. Vital signs regularly\n25. Labs weekly during refeeding\n26. EKG if electrolyte abnormalities\n\nFamily Involvement:\n\n27. Essential for recovery, especially at this age\n28. Psychoeducation for parents\n29. Family-based treatment (FBT/Maudsley) may be considered\n30. Family therapy to address dynamics\n\nDisposition Today:\n\n31. Await labs and EKG\n32. If potassium low or EKG abnormal: Direct medical admission\n33. If stable: Arrange urgent admission to eating disorder treatment program\n34. Patient and mother counseled on severity and need for treatment\n\nSafety:\n\n35. No SI currently, but depression present\n36. Suicide risk elevated in AN - monitor\n37. No access to laxatives, diet pills\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n38. Multidisciplinary team: Psychiatry, medicine, nutrition, therapy\n39. Long-term treatment (AN has high relapse rate)\n40. Regular medical monitoring for complications\n\nPrognosis Discussion:\n\n41. AN has highest mortality of any psychiatric illness\n42. Early intervention improves outcomes\n43. Full recovery possible but takes time (years for many)\n44. Close monitoring for years after acute treatment"

Starting: Sertraline 25 mg \u2192 50 mg\n\nAs-Needed Medication (Adjunctive for Performance Situations):\n\n8. Beta-blocker for performance anxiety:\n   - Propranolol 10-40 mg, 30-60 minutes before event\n   - Reduces physical symptoms (tremor, racing heart, sweating)\n   - Doesn't treat underlying anxiety but helps performance\n   - Test dose before important event to assess response\n   - Not a substitute for CBT and SSRI\n\n9. Prescribing: Propranolol 10 mg, take 1 hour before presentation/meeting as needed\n   - Check BP (avoid if hypotension)\n   - Avoid if asthma, certain cardiac conditions\n\n10. Avoid benzodiazepines PRN:\n    - Can lead to dependence\n    - Impairs exposure therapy learning\n    - Reserved for severe cases with caution\n\nAlcohol Use:\n\n11. Using alcohol to cope - concerning pattern\n12. Discuss: Alcohol provides temporary relief but worsens anxiety long-term\n13. Goal: Replace alcohol coping with healthier strategies (skills from CBT)\n14. Monitor for escalation\n15. Stop alcohol before social events once treatment starts\n\nExposure Practice (Before Formal Therapy):\n\n16. Start small:\n    - Make eye contact and greet one new person/day\n    - Ask coworker a question\n    - Attend meeting (just attend, no pressure to speak)\n17. Each exposure reduces anxiety over time\n\nWorkplace:\n\n18. Consider disclosure if comfortable (to HR or trusted manager)\n19. Request accommodations if helpful:\n    - Written contributions instead of verbal\n    - Smaller meetings\n    - Advance notice of presentation topics\n20. Long-term goal: Be able to present and advance career\n\nLifestyle:\n\n21. Exercise: Regular exercise reduces baseline anxiety\n22. Sleep: Adequate sleep important\n23. Caffeine: Reduce if excessive (worsens physical anxiety symptoms)\n24. Relaxation: Progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing\n\nSocial Support:\n\n25. Reconnect gradually with friends\n26. Consider social activities with low pressure (hiking, gaming groups)\n27. Dating apps with low-pressure first dates (coffee, brief)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n28. Return in 3-4 weeks:\n    - SSRI tolerance\n    - Beta-blocker use and response\n    - Therapy started\n    - Early exposure successes\n\n29. Therapy: Arrange CBT referral ASAP\n30. Adjust medications as needed at follow-up\n\nPatient Education:\n\n31. Social anxiety is very treatable\n32. CBT has excellent long-term outcomes\n33. Medication + therapy is most effective\n34. Avoidance maintains anxiety - exposure breaks the cycle\n35. Progress may be gradual but lasting"

Symptoms:\n\n- Contamination obsessions: Fear of germs, contamination from \"dirty\" surfaces, fear of spreading illness\n- Compulsions:\n  - Handwashing: 30+ times/day, until hands raw and bleeding\n  - Cleaning: 4+ hours daily cleaning home\n  - Checking: Checks locks, stove 15-20 times before leaving\n  - Avoidance: Won't touch doorknobs, use public restrooms, shake hands\n\nCurrent severity: Severe impairment\n- Cannot work (retired early due to OCD)\n- Rarely leaves home\n- Family frustrated\n- Y-BOCS: 32 (severe, obsessions 16, compulsions 16)\n\nCurrent treatment:\n- Sertraline 200 mg daily x 1 year\n- Previous: Fluoxetine (side effects), paroxetine (weight gain)\n- ERP therapy: Did 12 sessions 5 years ago, helped somewhat, stopped going\n\nCurrent response to sertraline 200 mg:\n- \"Takes edge off\" (maybe 20% improvement)\n- Tolerable side effects (dry mouth, mild sexual dysfunction)\n- Still severely impaired\n\nPast Medical History: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia\nMedications:\n- Sertraline 200 mg daily\n- Lisinopril 10 mg daily\n- Atorvastatin 20 mg daily\nAllergies: NKDA\nFamily History: Mother had \"rituals,\" never diagnosed\nSocial: Married, retired teacher, non-smoker\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 128/78, HR 70\n\nGeneral: Anxious, hands visibly cracked and dry, uses hand sanitizer in office\n\nMental Status Exam:\n- Appearance: Well-groomed, visible hand dermatitis\n- Behavior: Anxious, avoids touching objects in office, uses tissue to touch chair\n- Speech: Normal\n- Mood: \"Frustrated\"\n- Affect: Anxious, appropriate\n- Thought Process: Linear, but ruminative about contamination\n- Thought Content: Intrusive thoughts about contamination, recognizes as excessive (ego-dystonic), no SI/HI, no psychosis\n- Insight: Good (knows thoughts are irrational but cannot stop)\n- Judgment: Fair (seeking help)\n\nScales:\n- Y-BOCS: 32/40 (severe; scores >24 are severe)\n- PHQ-9: 10 (moderate depression, secondary)\n\nHands: Dermatitis on both hands from excessive washing (erythema, cracking, bleeding areas)\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Severe, Partial Response to SSRI (ICD-10: F42.2)\n\n- Contamination subtype + checking\n- On sertraline 200 mg (maximum typical dose) x 1 year\n- Partial response (~20-30% improvement)\n- Still severe impairment (Y-BOCS 32)\n- ERP therapy not ongoing (key gap in treatment)\n\nTreatment-Resistant OCD Considerations:\n- Definition: Inadequate response to adequate SSRI trial (10-12 weeks at max dose)\n- Patient meets criteria: 1 year on sertraline 200 mg with partial response\n\n### Plan\nMedication Optimization Strategies:\n\n1. Options for OCD with partial SSRI response:\n   a) High-dose SSRI (above typical maximum)\n   b) Switch to different SSRI (clomipramine most effective)\n   c) Augmentation (antipsychotic, or glutamate modulator)\n   d) Combination strategies\n\n2. Strategy 1: Increase Sertraline (High-Dose SSRI)\n   - OCD often requires higher SSRI doses than depression\n   - Sertraline can be increased to 250-400 mg/day for OCD (off-label)\n   - Plan: Increase to 250 mg daily, then 300 mg after 2 weeks if tolerated\n   - Monitor for side effects (serotonin syndrome, QTc prolongation)\n   - EKG if going above 200 mg\n\n3. Strategy 2: Consider Clomipramine (Switch or Augment)\n   - Tricyclic antidepressant, most effective medication for OCD\n   - More side effects (anticholinergic, cardiac)\n   - Target: 150-250 mg/day\n   - Can use alone or add to SSRI (caution: drug interactions, serotonin syndrome risk)\n   - Reserved if SSRI strategies fail\n\n4. Strategy 3: Atypical Antipsychotic Augmentation\n   - Add low-dose antipsychotic to SSRI\n   - Best evidence: Risperidone 0.5-2 mg, Aripiprazole 5-15 mg\n   - ~30% of non-responders improve with augmentation\n   - Metabolic monitoring required\n\n5. Plan today:\n   - Increase sertraline from 200 mg to 250 mg daily\n   - EKG baseline (QTc monitoring at higher doses)\n   - If no improvement in 4-6 weeks: Add aripiprazole 2 mg\n\n6. Order: EKG (check QTc) before increasing sertraline\n\nExposure and Response Prevention (ERP) - CRITICAL:\n\n7. ERP is ESSENTIAL for OCD treatment - medication alone often insufficient\n8. Patient did ERP 5 years ago, not current\n9. Strong recommendation to restart ERP therapy\n10. Referral to OCD specialist/therapist trained in ERP\n11. ERP components:\n    - Exposure to feared situations (touch \"contaminated\" surface)\n    - Response prevention (don't wash hands for extended period)\n    - Habituation occurs - anxiety decreases without compulsion\n\n12. Frequency: Weekly sessions, with daily exposure homework\n13. Can be done in-person or via telehealth\n\nIntensive Treatment Options (If Outpatient Fails):\n\n14. If still refractory:\n    - Intensive outpatient program (IOP) for OCD\n    - Residential OCD treatment program\n    - TMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) - FDA-cleared for OCD\n    - Deep brain stimulation (last resort for severe refractory OCD)\n\nHand Dermatitis:\n\n15. Hands are damaged from excessive washing\n16. Dermatology referral for dermatitis management\n17. Emollients: Apply thick moisturizer (Eucerin, Aquaphor) after each wash\n18. Gloves at night with moisturizer\n19. Topical steroid (hydrocortisone 2.5% or triamcinolone 0.1%) for inflammation\n20. Handwashing should be target of ERP therapy\n\nDepression:\n\n21. PHQ-9: 10 - likely secondary to OCD severity and impairment\n22. Expect improvement with OCD treatment\n23. Monitor, address if persistent\n\nFamily Involvement:\n\n24. OCD often involves family in rituals (accommodation)\n25. Family education about OCD and ERP\n26. Family should stop participating in rituals (with guidance)\n27. Consider family therapy if significant accommodation\n\nLifestyle:\n\n28. Exercise: Helps anxiety\n29. Stress reduction: Mindfulness (adjunctive, not replacement for ERP)\n30. Avoid reassurance-seeking (maintains OCD)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n31. EKG before dose increase\n32. Return in 4 weeks:\n    - Assess response to sertraline 250 mg\n    - Y-BOCS recheck\n    - Consider further increase or augmentation\n33. ERP therapy referral made - follow up on intake\n34. Dermatology for hands\n\nPatient Education:\n\n35. OCD is chronic but very treatable\n36. ERP + medication = best outcomes (neither alone as effective)\n37. ERP is uncomfortable initially but leads to lasting improvement\n38. Medication doses for OCD are often higher than for depression\n39. Recovery is possible - significant symptom reduction expected with proper treatment"

Check for history of demyelinating disease, heart failure (TNFi)\n\nNSAIDs for Axial Symptoms:\n18. NSAIDs for pain relief (especially axial):\n    - Naproxen 500mg BID or Indomethacin 75mg daily\n19. Continuous preferred over PRN for inflammatory back pain\n\nEnthesitis Management:\n20. Biologics (TNFi, IL-17i) most effective\n21. Local measures: Ice, stretching, PT\n22. Corticosteroid injection (peritendinous, not into Achilles tendon)\n23. Night splints or orthotics\n\nDactylitis:\n24. Systemic therapy (biologics) most effective\n25. Local steroid injection (into flexor sheath)\n\nSkin and Nails:\n26. Topical therapy for mild psoriasis (continue)\n27. Biologics will improve skin significantly\n28. Nails often slow to respond (6-12 months)\n\nLocal Therapy:\n29. Intra-articular corticosteroid for acutely inflamed peripheral joint if needed\n30. Physical therapy for spine mobility and function\n\nMonitoring:\n31. Disease activity assessment: MDA criteria\n32. DAPSA score for peripheral disease\n33. BASDAI for axial symptoms\n34. PASI for skin\n35. CRP/ESR every 3-6 months\n36. LFTs, CBC if on MTX\n\nComorbidity Screening:\n37.

Edema management:\n    - Loop diuretic: Furosemide 20-40 mg daily as needed\n    - Low-sodium diet\n\n14. Avoid NSAIDs (worsen renal function)\n\nInduction Therapy (After Biopsy Confirms Class III-V):\n\n15. Class III/IV Lupus Nephritis:\n    - Corticosteroids (high dose) + immunosuppressive agent\n\n16. Steroid induction:\n    - Methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg IV daily x 3 days (pulse)\n    - Then prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (max 60-80 mg), taper over months\n\n17. Immunosuppressive options:\n    a) Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 2-3 g/day (first-line)\n    b) Cyclophosphamide IV (Euro-Lupus or NIH protocol)\n    c) Combination may include calcineurin inhibitor (voclosporin, tacrolimus)\n\n18. Voclosporin (new option):\n    - FDA-approved for lupus nephritis\n    - Added to MMF + steroids\n    - Consider for Class III-V\n\n19. Class V (pure membranous):\n    - MMF + steroids\n    - May add calcineurin inhibitor\n\n20. Plan: After biopsy, start pulse steroids + MMF (or per biopsy results)\n\nMaintenance Therapy (After Induction):\n\n21. After 6-12 months of induction:\n    - Transition to maintenance\n    - MMF 1-2 g/day OR azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day\n    - Continue low-dose prednisone (5-10 mg)\n    - Continue HCQ indefinitely\n\nMonitoring During Treatment:\n\n22.

Reports:\n- Sudden onset severe pain left first MTP joint overnight\n- Woke from sleep with pain\n- Swelling, redness, extreme tenderness\n- Cannot bear weight or tolerate shoe\n- Cannot tolerate even bed sheet touching toe\n- No trauma\n- No fever\n- No other joints involved\n\nHistory of gout: One prior episode 2 years ago, not on chronic therapy\nDiet: High meat intake, drinks 2-3 beers daily\n\nPast Medical History: Hypertension, CKD stage 2, obesity\nMedications: Losartan 50 mg (note: ARBs can elevate uric acid, but losartan has uricosuric effect), HCTZ 25 mg (thiazides elevate uric acid)\nAllergies: NKDA\n\n### Objective\nVital Signs: BP 148/92, HR 78, Temp 99.2\u00b0F, Weight 240 lbs, BMI 34\n\nGeneral: Uncomfortable, holding left foot off ground\n\nLeft foot:\n- First MTP joint: Swollen, erythematous, exquisitely tender\n- Overlying skin red, shiny\n- Cannot tolerate light touch\n- Warmth present\n- No open wound, no signs of cellulitis spreading\n\nOther joints: No swelling\n\nLabs:\n- Serum uric acid: 9.8 mg/dL (elevated, normal <7)\n- Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL, eGFR 58 (CKD stage 3a)\n- WBC: 12,000/mm\u00b3 (mild elevation)\n- CRP: 8.5 mg/dL (elevated)\n\nJoint aspiration (performed):\n- Fluid: Cloudy, yellow\n- WBC: 45,000/mm\u00b3 (inflammatory)\n- Crystals: Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent under polarized light = MONOSODIUM URATE CRYSTALS\n- Gram stain: Negative\n- Culture: Pending\n\n### Assessment\nDiagnosis: Acute Gouty Arthritis, Left First MTP (Podagra) (ICD-10: M10.071)\n\nDiagnosis confirmed by:\n- Classic presentation (podagra, sudden onset, severe pain)\n- Crystal-proven: MSU crystals in synovial fluid (gold standard)\n- Elevated serum uric acid\n- No evidence of septic joint (negative Gram stain, but follow culture)\n\n### Plan\nAcute Flare Treatment:\n\n1. Treatment goals: Reduce inflammation, relieve pain\n\n2. First-line options for acute gout flare:\n   a) NSAIDs (if no contraindications)\n   b) Colchicine\n   c) Corticosteroids (oral, IA, or IM)\n\n3. This patient: CKD stage 3 (eGFR 58) - caution with NSAIDs\n\n4. Chosen treatment: Prednisone (oral corticosteroid)\n   - Safe in CKD\n   - Effective for acute flare\n   - Dose: Prednisone 40 mg daily x 5 days (or taper)\n   - Alternative: Prednisone 40 mg x 3 days, then 30 x 2, then 20 x 2, then 10 x 2, then stop\n\n5. Prescribe: Prednisone 40 mg, take 1 tablet daily for 5 days\n\n6. Colchicine option (if steroids contraindicated or as adjunct):\n   - Low-dose regimen: 1.2 mg at first sign, then 0.6 mg 1 hour later (total 1.8 mg day 1)\n   - Then 0.6 mg once or twice daily until flare resolves\n   - Reduce dose in CKD (patient's eGFR 58 - use with caution, reduce dose)\n   - Avoid high-dose colchicine (GI toxicity)\n\n7. NSAIDs (if CKD were not an issue):\n   - Indomethacin 50 mg TID x 5-7 days\n   - Naproxen 500 mg BID\n   - AVOID in this patient due to CKD\n\n8. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection:\n   - Alternative for monoarticular gout\n   - Triamcinolone 10-20 mg injected into first MTP joint\n   - Not done today as aspiration was diagnostic\n\nPain Management:\n\n9. Rest, elevate foot\n10. Ice pack to affected joint (15-20 min several times daily)\n11. Avoid bearing weight\n12. Acetaminophen 650 mg q6h PRN for additional pain relief\n13. Avoid aspirin (affects uric acid levels at low doses)\n\nDuring Acute Flare:\n\n14. Do NOT start urate-lowering therapy (ULT) during acute flare:\n    - Starting allopurinol during flare can worsen/prolong attack\n    - Wait until flare fully resolved (~2 weeks)\n\n15. If already on ULT: Do NOT stop it during flare (continue at same dose)\n\nAddressing Precipitating Factors:\n\n16. Review medications:\n    - HCTZ (thiazide diuretic): Increases uric acid\n    - Consider switching to alternative antihypertensive if possible\n    - Losartan: Actually has uricosuric effect (can continue)\n\n17. Diet and lifestyle:\n    - Reduce alcohol (especially beer - high purine)\n    - Reduce high-purine foods: Red meat, organ meats, shellfish\n    - Increase hydration (2-3 L water daily)\n    - Weight loss (gradual)\n    - Avoid sugary drinks (fructose increases uric acid)\n\n18. Dietary counseling provided\n\nUrate-Lowering Therapy (After Flare Resolves):\n\n19. Indications for chronic ULT:\n    - \u22652 gout flares per year\n    - Tophi\n    - CKD with gout\n    - Uric acid nephrolithiasis\n    - Very high uric acid levels\n\n20. This patient has CKD + gout (indication for ULT)\n\n21. Plan: Start ULT 2-4 weeks after flare resolves\n\n22. First-line ULT: Allopurinol\n    - Start low: Allopurinol 100 mg daily (start low in CKD)\n    - Titrate: Increase by 100 mg every 2-4 weeks\n    - Target: Serum uric acid <6 mg/dL (or <5 if tophi)\n    - Max dose varies by renal function but can safely go higher if tolerated\n\n23. HLA-B*5801 testing:\n    - Consider in high-risk populations (Asian, African descent)\n    - Associated with severe allopurinol hypersensitivity (SJS/TEN)\n    - If positive: Use febuxostat instead\n\n24. Alternative ULT: Febuxostat (Uloric) 40-80 mg daily\n    - If allopurinol intolerant or contraindicated\n    - No renal dose adjustment needed\n    - Caution: Some cardiovascular risk signal\n\nFlare Prophylaxis (When Starting ULT):\n\n25. When starting ULT, give flare prophylaxis:\n    - Colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for 3-6 months\n    - Or low-dose NSAID if tolerated\n    - Prevents flares triggered by uric acid changes\n\nMonitoring:\n\n26. Recheck uric acid level in 2-4 weeks (after flare resolved)\n27. When on ULT: Uric acid every 2-4 weeks during titration, then every 6 months\n28. Goal uric acid: <6 mg/dL\n29. Monitor renal function (on allopurinol, especially in CKD)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n30. Return in 2-3 weeks:\n    - Flare should be resolved\n    - Discuss ULT initiation\n    - Review diet and lifestyle changes\n\n31. If flare not improving in 48-72 hours: Return for reassessment (consider septic joint)\n\n32. Culture result: Will call if positive (rule out septic arthritis)\n\nPatient Education:\n\n33. Gout is caused by uric acid crystals in joints\n34. Acute treatment is for inflammation, not to lower uric acid\n35. Long-term treatment (allopurinol) lowers uric acid and prevents flares\n36. Diet and alcohol modification important\n37. Do not stop allopurinol once started (even during flares)\n38. Flares may still occur initially when starting ULT - prophylaxis given"

Fibromyalgia is a real condition:\n   - Central sensitization disorder (brain amplifies pain signals)\n   - Not inflammatory, not autoimmune, not degenerative\n   - Validated by normal labs and exams\n\n2. Management requires multimodal approach:\n   - Medications alone insufficient\n   - Exercise, sleep, and stress management equally important\n\n3. Set realistic expectations:\n   - Goal is improvement in function and quality of life\n   - Complete pain elimination unlikely\n\nNon-Pharmacologic Therapy (Foundation of Treatment):\n\n4. Exercise (Most Evidence-Based Treatment):\n   - Aerobic exercise: Start low, go slow\n   - Walking, swimming, cycling\n   - Begin 10-15 minutes, 3x/week\n   - Gradually increase to 30 min, 5x/week\n   - May feel worse initially, improves over weeks\n\n5. Physical therapy referral:\n   - Graded exercise program\n   - Aquatic therapy (warm water)\n   - Stretching and strengthening\n\n6. Sleep Hygiene:\n   - Consistent sleep/wake times\n   - Avoid screens before bed\n   - Cool, dark room\n   - Avoid caffeine after noon\n   - Limit naps\n\n7. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):\n   - Proven benefit in fibromyalgia\n   - Addresses pain catastrophizing, coping skills\n   - Also helps depression/anxiety\n\n8. Stress reduction:\n   - Mindfulness-based stress reduction\n   - Relaxation techniques\n   - Pacing activities\n\nPharmacologic Therapy:\n\nFirst-Line Medications:\n\n9. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) 30-60 mg daily:\n   - FDA-approved for fibromyalgia\n   - SNRI - helps pain, depression, fatigue\n   - Can replace sertraline or add\n   - Start 30 mg, increase to 60 mg after 1 week\n   - Side effects: Nausea, dizziness, insomnia\n\n10. Alternative: Milnacipran (Savella):\n    - SNRI, FDA-approved for fibromyalgia\n    - 12.5 mg day 1, titrate to 50 mg BID\n\n11. Pregabalin (Lyrica):\n    - FDA-approved for fibromyalgia\n    - Start 75 mg BID, increase to 150-225 mg BID\n    - Helps pain, sleep, anxiety\n    - Side effects: Dizziness, weight gain, edema\n\n12. Alternative: Gabapentin (off-label):\n    - 300 mg TID, titrate up\n    - Similar mechanism to pregabalin, less expensive\n\nSecond-Line/Adjunct:\n\n13. Low-dose tricyclic antidepressant (for sleep/pain):\n    - Amitriptyline 10-25 mg at bedtime\n    - Or cyclobenzaprine 5-10 mg at bedtime\n    - Improves sleep, reduces pain\n\n14. Trazodone 25-50 mg at bedtime for sleep (if needed)\n\nAvoid:\n\n15. Opioids: NOT recommended for fibromyalgia\n    - Ineffective, risk of dependence\n    - May worsen central sensitization\n\n16. Long-term NSAIDs: Minimal benefit, side effect risk\n\n17. Benzodiazepines: Avoid if possible (worsen sleep architecture)\n\nDepression Management:\n\n18. Current moderate depression: Address with above medications (duloxetine/pregabalin) plus CBT\n19. If inadequate: Psychiatry referral\n20. Pain and depression bidirectionally worsen each other\n\nMy Chosen Plan:\n\n21. Start Duloxetine 30 mg daily (replacing sertraline after taper)\n22. Add Pregabalin 75 mg at bedtime initially\n23. Titrate both as tolerated\n24. Physical therapy referral\n25. Sleep hygiene counseling\n26. CBT referral\n\nComplementary Approaches:\n\n27. Massage therapy\n28. Acupuncture (may help some patients)\n29. Yoga, tai chi\n30. Warm water therapy\n\nVitamin D:\n\n31. Vitamin D level 28 (low normal)\n32. Supplement: Vitamin D 2000 IU daily\n33. Low vitamin D associated with more pain\n\nMonitoring:\n\n34. Pain scales, functional assessment at visits\n35. FIQ (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire)\n36. PHQ-9 for depression\n37. Sleep quality assessment\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n38. Rheumatology/PCP in 4-6 weeks\n39. Adjust medications based on response\n40. Reinforce exercise and non-pharmacologic therapies"

Joint aspiration performed:\n   - Therapeutic: Removes inflammatory fluid and crystals\n   - Diagnostic: Crystal analysis\n\n2. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection:\n   - Triamcinolone 40 mg injected into left knee\n   - Very effective for monoarticular CPPD\n   - Rapid relief expected within 24-48 hours\n\n3. NSAIDs (if no contraindications):\n   - Patient has diabetes (relative caution)\n   - Naproxen 500 mg BID x 5-7 days\n   - With food, short course\n   - Monitor glucose (NSAIDs can affect renal function/interact)\n\n4. Colchicine alternative:\n   - Colchicine 0.6 mg BID for 5-7 days\n   - Effective for acute CPPD\n   - May use if NSAIDs contraindicated\n\n5. Oral corticosteroids (if polyarticular or if NSAIDs/colchicine contraindicated):\n   - Prednisone 30-40 mg x 5 days\n   - Not first-line for monoarticular (injection preferred)\n\n6. Ice, rest, elevate affected knee\n\nRule Out Secondary Causes:\n\n7. CPPD can be associated with metabolic disorders:\n   - Hemochromatosis\n   - Hyperparathyroidism\n   - Hypomagnesemia\n   - Hypothyroidism\n   - Hypophosphatasia (rare)\n\n8. Screening labs ordered:\n   - Calcium: 9.5 (normal) \u2192 Hyperparathyroidism less likely\n   - Magnesium: 1.8 (low normal) \u2192 Supplement if low\n   - Ferritin: 180 (normal) \u2192 Hemochromatosis less likely\n   - TSH: 2.2 (normal) \u2192 Hypothyroidism ruled out\n   - Parathyroid hormone (PTH): Order to complete workup\n   - Iron studies, transferrin saturation: Order\n\n9. If ferritin elevated or transferrin saturation high: Evaluate for hemochromatosis\n\n10. Most CPPD is idiopathic (age-related)\n\nProphylaxis (If Recurrent Attacks):\n\n11. No established prophylactic therapy as effective as in gout\n\n12. Daily low-dose colchicine 0.6 mg daily:\n    - May reduce frequency of attacks\n    - Used if frequent recurrences\n\n13. No urate-lowering therapy equivalent for CPPD:\n    - No medication dissolves CPP crystals\n    - Cannot \"cure\" CPPD like gout with allopurinol\n\nMagnesium:\n\n14. Low magnesium associated with CPPD\n15. Consider magnesium supplementation: Magnesium oxide 400-800 mg daily\n16. Some evidence it may reduce crystal formation\n\nJoint Protection:\n\n17. Weight management\n18. Physical therapy for knee strengthening\n19. Avoid repeated trauma\n\nChronic CPPD:\n\n20. If develops chronic inflammatory arthritis:\n    - Methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine may be tried\n    - Evidence is limited\n\n21. May develop degenerative joint disease:\n    - Manage as osteoarthritis\n    - Joint replacement if severe\n\nMonitoring:\n\n22. Follow-up in 1-2 weeks to ensure resolution\n23. Culture result will be called if positive (rule out septic joint)\n24. Recheck metabolic screen results\n\nPatient Education:\n\n25. Pseudogout is caused by calcium crystals (different from gout)\n26. Attacks are treated similarly to gout\n27. No way to dissolve the crystals (unlike gout)\n28. May have recurrent attacks\n29. Not caused by diet\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n30. Return in 1-2 weeks for reassessment\n31. Sooner if not improving or worsening (concern for infection)\n32. Rheumatology follow-up if frequent recurrences"

Enthesitis treatment:\n   - NSAIDs as above\n   - Heel cups, orthotic inserts\n   - Avoid barefoot walking\n   - Physical therapy for stretching\n\nEye Management:\n\n4. Conjunctivitis:\n   - Usually self-limited\n   - Artificial tears\n   - Ophthalmology follow-up\n\n5. Monitor for anterior uveitis:\n   - More serious, can occur in ReA\n   - Symptoms: Eye pain, photophobia, blurred vision\n   - Requires urgent ophthalmology and topical steroids\n\nUrethritis:\n\n6. Sterile urethritis is part of ReA (not active infection)\n7. No antibiotics needed (cultures negative)\n8. Will improve with systemic treatment\n\nAntibiotics for Triggering Infection:\n\n9. GI infection has resolved: No current antibiotics needed\n10. If Chlamydia-triggered ReA: Would treat with azithromycin or doxycycline\n11. Antibiotics do NOT treat the arthritis itself\n\nDMARD Therapy (If Chronic/Refractory):\n\n12. Many cases of ReA are self-limited (weeks to months)\n\n13. If symptoms persist >3 months or severe:\n    - Sulfasalazine 2-3 g/day\n    - Effective for peripheral arthritis in spondyloarthropathies\n\n14. If sulfasalazine fails or axial involvement prominent:\n    - TNF inhibitors (Adalimumab, Etanercept)\n    - Off-label but effective\n\n15. Methotrexate: Can be considered for peripheral arthritis\n\nPrognosis:\n\n16. Most cases resolve within 3-12 months\n17. Some develop chronic ReA (~20%)\n18. HLA-B27 positive may have worse prognosis (more chronic, axial involvement)\n19. Recurrence possible with repeat infections\n\nAxial Disease:\n\n20. Sacroiliitis present on MRI\n21. Monitor for progression to chronic spondyloarthropathy\n22. NSAIDs help axial symptoms\n23. If chronic axial disease: TNF inhibitors\n\nPhysical Therapy:\n\n24. Range of motion exercises\n25. Strengthening once acute inflammation controlled\n26. Posture exercises if axial involvement\n\nSkin Monitoring:\n\n27. Watch for:\n    - Keratoderma blennorrhagicum: Pustular lesions on palms/soles\n    - Circinate balanitis: Painless shallow ulcers on glans penis (not applicable here)\n    - If develop: Often respond to systemic treatment\n\nEducation:\n\n28. Reactive arthritis is triggered by infection but not an active infection in joints\n29. Joints are sterile (autoimmune/inflammatory response)\n30. Most cases improve with time\n31. Avoid re-exposure to triggering pathogens (food safety)\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n32. Rheumatology in 2-4 weeks\n33. Assess response to NSAIDs\n34. Ophthalmology follow-up for eye symptoms\n35. If no improvement: Escalate to sulfasalazine or biologics"

HIGH-DOSE IV CORTICOSTEROIDS - START NOW:\n   - Methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV daily x 3 days\n   - For visual involvement, IV pulse therapy is standard\n   - Do NOT wait for temporal artery biopsy\n\n2. After IV pulse:\n   - Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (60-80 mg daily)\n   - Continue until symptoms resolve and ESR/CRP normalize\n\n3. Rationale for immediate treatment:\n   - Vision loss in GCA is usually irreversible\n   - Contralateral eye at high risk (can lose vision in days)\n   - Treatment can prevent contralateral blindness\n   - Biopsy remains positive for 1-2 weeks after starting steroids\n\nTemporal Artery Biopsy:\n\n4. Temporal artery biopsy:\n   - Obtain within 1-2 weeks of starting steroids\n   - Steroids do NOT immediately change pathology\n   - Biopsy at least 1.5-2 cm length (skip lesions possible)\n   - Positive biopsy: Granulomatous inflammation, giant cells\n   - Negative biopsy does not rule out GCA (skip lesions, contralateral involvement)\n\n5. Consider bilateral biopsy if unilateral negative and clinical suspicion high\n\n6. Arrange vascular surgery or ophthalmology for biopsy\n\nOphthalmology (Urgent):\n\n7. Ophthalmology emergency consultation - DONE\n8. Document baseline visual acuity, fields, fundus\n9. Monitor for contralateral involvement\n10. If visual deterioration: May need repeat IV pulse\n\nSteroid Taper (Long-Term):\n\n11. After stabilization:\n    - Maintain high-dose prednisone (60 mg) x 2-4 weeks\n    - Taper by 10 mg every 2 weeks to 40 mg\n    - Then 5 mg every 2 weeks to 20 mg\n    - Then 2.5 mg every 2-4 weeks to 10 mg\n    - Then 1 mg every month\n    - Total treatment duration: 1-2 years typically\n\n12. Taper guided by symptoms and inflammatory markers\n\n13. Flare during taper: Return to last effective dose\n\nTocilizumab (Steroid-Sparing Agent):\n\n14. Tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor):\n    - FDA approved for GCA\n    - Reduces relapse rate, allows faster steroid taper\n    - Consider adding early (within first month)\n    - Dose: 162 mg SQ weekly or every 2 weeks\n    - Particularly useful for steroid-related complications or frequent relapses\n\n15. Pre-tocilizumab screening:\n    - TB, Hepatitis B/C\n    - Lipid panel (can elevate cholesterol)\n    - Note: Tocilizumab suppresses CRP (cannot use as activity marker)\n\nAspirin:\n\n16. Low-dose aspirin 81 mg daily:\n    - May reduce ischemic events (visual loss, stroke)\n    - Start if no contraindications\n    - Some controversy, but commonly used\n\nMonitoring:\n\n17. ESR and CRP every 2-4 weeks during taper\n18. Watch for symptoms of relapse:\n    - Headache recurrence\n    - Jaw claudication\n    - Visual symptoms\n    - PMR symptoms\n\n19. If on tocilizumab: CRP unreliable (suppressed by drug)\n\nSteroid Side Effect Prevention:\n\n20. Bone protection (CRITICAL with high-dose steroids):\n    - Calcium 1200 mg + Vitamin D 1000 IU daily\n    - DEXA scan\n    - Start bisphosphonate (alendronate, zoledronic acid)\n\n21. Blood pressure monitoring (steroids elevate BP)\n\n22. Glucose monitoring (steroid-induced diabetes)\n\n23. PPI for GI protection if on aspirin + steroids\n\n24. Monitor for cataracts, glaucoma (ophthalmology follow-up)\n\n25. Monitor mood (steroid-induced psychiatric effects)\n\nLarge Vessel Involvement:\n\n26. GCA can affect aorta and branches (not just temporal artery)\n27. Consider CT angiography or PET-CT if:\n    - Arm claudication\n    - Blood pressure differential between arms\n    - Aortic aneurysm screening\n\n28. Annual imaging for aortic aneurysm (thoracic aorta) recommended\n\nPatient Education:\n\n29. GCA is a medical emergency when vision is involved\n30. Steroids are lifesaving (prevent blindness)\n31. Long-term treatment required (years)\n32. Report any new visual symptoms IMMEDIATELY\n33. Side effects of steroids explained\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n34. Rheumatology within 1 week\n35. Ophthalmology within 1-2 days and ongoing\n36. Arrange temporal artery biopsy within 1 week\n37. Labs (ESR, CRP, glucose) in 1-2 weeks"
